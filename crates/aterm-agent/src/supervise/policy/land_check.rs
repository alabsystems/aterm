//! THE LAND CHECK (`land-check@v1`, `docs/DESIGN-harness-autopilot-2026-10-15.md` §14.17 item 5):
//! the one prompt that decides a landing. At a Land point whose reply defends the work with
//! `Nothing left:` over a clean repository read, Land does not land on the defense's words: it
//! types this check once, and the agent's literal answer decides. `LANDED` alone lands the task;
//! a `NEEDS YOU:` line is a need, shown quietly; anything else is the agent's own list of what is
//! left, which Land's next prompt quotes ([`listed_suffix`]).
//!
//! The words are frozen as `land-check@v1` (their sha256 is in KI-1020-2 and the slice's As built
//! note); any change to them is a `land-check@v2`, measured afresh. The word reader is only a
//! hint here ([`hint_clause`]): it picks the one clause of the report the check quotes first.
