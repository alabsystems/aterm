//! [`SealedStream`] — a transparent, ordered-record AEAD adapter over any
//! `Read + Write`, so an existing length-prefixed protocol becomes confidential
//! and authenticated with no change to the protocol code above it.
//!
//! # Handshake: session freshness and direction binding
//! A stream is opened with [`SealedStream::handshake_client`] on one end and
//! [`SealedStream::handshake_server`] on the other. Each side sends one HELLO in
//! the clear — [`HELLO_MAGIC`] ‖ [`SESSION_NONCE_LEN`] bytes from the OS CSPRNG —
//! then reads the peer's. Every record's AAD is then
//!
//! ```text
//! hello_client ‖ hello_server ‖ direction ‖ seq        (36 + 36 + 1 + 8 bytes)
//! ```
//!
//! with `direction` = 0x01 for client→server / 0x02 for server→client and `seq`
//! the per-direction record counter (u64 little-endian, from 0). Both hellos are
//! fresh per connection and one of them is always chosen by the honest side, so
//! a record is valid ONLY for this connection, this direction, and this
//! position: a record recorded from any other connection (either direction), a
//! record reflected back at its sender, and a record replayed, reordered,
//! dropped, or truncated within the connection all fail their tag. The
//! handshake ends with each side sending a CONFIRM — record 0 of its direction,
//! empty — that the peer must open before the handshake returns: key possession
//! and the hello transcript are confirmed before any application byte flows,
//! and a peer without the key is refused inside the handshake. Still pre-shared:
//! the key itself; an online key agreement (forward secrecy) is the rung above.
//!
//! # Framing
//! Each `write(buf)` seals `buf` into one or more records of at most
//! [`MAX_PLAINTEXT`] plaintext bytes each (like TLS's 16 KiB record ceiling)
//! and emits `len: u32-le ‖ nonce ‖ ciphertext ‖ tag` per record. Each `read`
//! drains from the currently-open record, opening the next on demand — so the
//! caller sees a plain byte stream and its own framing (the broker's `Frame`)
//! rides inside, blind to the record boundaries beneath it. An empty record is
//! skipped, never reported as EOF: `Ok(0)` from `read` means the peer closed at
//! a record boundary, exactly as the `Read` contract requires.
//!
//! # Bounds
//! A record whose length prefix exceeds [`MAX_RECORD`] is rejected before any of
//! it is read, so a hostile prefix pins at most `MAX_RECORD` bytes; the one
//! record read before the peer has authenticated (its confirm) is capped at
//! exactly [`OVERHEAD`](crate::OVERHEAD) bytes, so an unkeyed peer can make the
//! reader allocate nothing beyond that. A partial or timed-out transport read is
//! resumed at the same record boundary by the next `read`, never desynced.
//!
//! Honest boundary: there is no close-notify record. A transport cut exactly at a
//! record boundary is indistinguishable from an orderly close (`read` returns
//! `Ok(0)`); a cut inside a record is truncation and errors. What an early EOF
//! means is decided by the protocol above, exactly as it is on a plain socket.
//!
//! # Shared counters across clones
//! The send and receive counters are shared (`Arc`) across
//! [`SealedStream::try_clone`], so a second handle to the same socket (the
//! broker's ack-writer half) keeps a single gap-free record sequence per
//! direction. A `write` seals all of its records under the send lock, so the
//! records of two handles never interleave within one write.
