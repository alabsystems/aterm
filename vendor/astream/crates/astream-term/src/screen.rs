//! A pure VT/ECMA-48 screen: the deterministic fold of recorded output.
//!
//! [`fold`] turns an ordered slice of [`Record`]s into a [`Screen`] with no
//! clock, no randomness, and no I/O, so the same records always yield a
//! byte-identical screen ([`Screen::serialize`]). That purity is the spine of
//! the astream-term replay guarantee.
//!
//! ### Scope
//!
//! A deliberately bounded but real VT subset: C0 controls (CR/LF/TAB/BS, and
//! VT/FF as line feeds), index (IND/NEL/RI), CSI cursor motion
//! (CUU/CUD/CUF/CUB/CNL/CPL/CHA/VPA/CUP), erase (ED/EL/ECH), insert and delete
//! (ICH/DCH/IL/DL), SGR (the 16- and 256-colour palettes plus 24-bit truecolour
//! in both the `;` and the `:` sub-parameter form; bold, underline, reverse,
//! italic, blink (5 and 6 alike, as xterm), crossed-out and concealed, each with
//! its reset; a double underline, 21 or `4:2`, is an underline; faint is not
//! modelled), East Asian wide glyphs, zero-width Unicode combining marks (up to
//! [`MAX_COMBINING`] per cell), the alternate screen (`?1049`/`?47`/`?1047`),
//! cursor visibility (`?25`), save/restore cursor (DECSC/DECRC and `CSI s`/`u`,
//! one slot per screen buffer as in xterm), the DEC scrolling region (`DECSTBM`),
//! left/right margins (DECLRMM `?69` and DECSLRM `CSI Pl ; Pr s`),
//! origin mode (DECOM, `?6`), insert and newline mode (IRM and LNM, `CSI 4 h`,
//! `CSI 20 h`), scroll up and down
//! (SU/SD, `CSI S`/`CSI T`), RIS, and inline [`Record::Resize`]. The scroll
//! region is cross-validated against the production aterm engine (see
//! `term.fold.scroll-region`).
//!
//! Everything else in the byte stream is **consumed, never painted**, following
//! the ECMA-48 parser: OSC/DCS/APC/PM/SOS string sequences (window titles,
//! OSC-133 shell marks, image payloads) are swallowed up to their terminator
//! (`ESC \`, or BEL for OSC); escapes outside the subset (charset
//! designations other than the G0/G1 ones below, `ESC =`/`ESC >`) and CSI
//! sequences outside it (any with an intermediate byte, or a private marker
//! other than `?`) are skipped whole;
//! CMY/CMYK SGR (`38;3;…`, `38;4;…`) and truncated extended-colour forms are
//! consumed *with* their sub-parameters and leave the pen unchanged; DEL, and C1 controls arriving
//! as UTF-8 (U+0080..U+009F), are ignored; malformed UTF-8 (overlong,
//! surrogate, truncated, a stray continuation or 8-bit byte) yields one U+FFFD
//! per maximal subpart (Unicode 3.9) — a control character never lands in a
//! cell. `ESC` anywhere begins a new escape, and a
//! C0 control executes inside an unfinished CSI.
//!
//! Simplifications, documented so they are never mistaken for fidelity — each is
//! deterministic:
//!
//! * **Deferred line wrap** is modelled with xterm's last-column semantics: after
//!   the last column is painted the cursor reports `col == cols`, and the next
//!   glyph wraps. CR/LF/BS/CUB/CUF/CUU/CUD/CUP resolve the pending wrap back
//!   onto the last column first — so BS after a full line lands on the
//!   second-to-last column (`abcde BS X` on 5 columns is `abcXe`) — and so do
//!   ED/EL 0-2, which then erase from that column: xterm's `ClearRight` clears
//!   from `cur_col` inclusive, the parked glyph, and every erase ends in
//!   `ResetWrap` (util.c). TAB leaves the wrap pending, `ED 3` touches neither
//!   the screen nor the wrap, and DECSC/DECRC round-trip it (a restored cursor
//!   wraps on its next glyph, as in aterm/xterm). Scrolling honours the
//!   `DECSTBM` region, and CUU/CUD (and CNL/CPL) stop at its margins as in
//!   xterm.
//! * **Every blank the fold makes honours background-colour-erase** (`bce`):
//!   `ED`/`EL`, a line scrolled in, and the alternate-screen clears fill with
//!   the current SGR background, as xterm's `ClearCells` / `ScrnClearLines`
//!   write the current colour pair, not a hardcoded default blank
//!   (reverse-video bce is out of scope). Cross-validated against aterm.
//! * **One alternate buffer, as in xterm**: it is allocated blank on first
//!   use and persists across switches and across RIS (xterm's `ReallyReset`
//!   clears it only if it is up), with its own DECSC slot, which RIS keeps too.
//!   `?47` only switches; `?1047` switches and clears it on the way out;
//!   `?1049` saves the cursor, switches and clears it on the way in (even when
//!   already up), and restores the cursor on the way out (even when not up).
//!   Each clear is xterm's `ClearScreen` (charproc.c `srm_ALTBUF`,
//!   `srm_OPT_ALTBUF`, `srm_OPT_ALTBUF_CURSOR`), which resets the pending
//!   wrap. The cursor is otherwise shared between the buffers and never moved
//!   by a switch.
//! * **24-bit truecolour SGR** (`38;2;r;g;b`, `48;2;r;g;b`, `38:2::r:g:b`,
//!   `38:2:cs:r:g:b`, `38:2:r:g:b`, and their `48:2:…` counterparts) resolves
//!   onto [`Cell::fg_rgb`] / [`Cell::bg_rgb`] (including `bce` erases and DECSC/DECRC),
//!   while palette/default SGR codes clear the corresponding RGB override. A channel
//!   past 255 is clamped to 255, as aterm clamps it; the standards leave it undefined,
//!   xterm's `parse_extended_colors` drops the colour and Ghostty truncates the value.
//!   ICH/DCH/IL/DL and ECH follow xterm's `InsertChar`/`DeleteChar`/`InsertLine`/
//!   `DeleteLine`/`ClearRight`: each resets a pending wrap where it acts,
//!   IL/DL act only on a cursor inside the scrolling region and move it to
//!   the left margin, and every vacated cell takes the bce blank.
//! * **Left/right margins** follow xterm's `LEFT_RIGHT` flag. Under DECLRMM
//!   `CSI Pl ; Pr s` is DECSLRM, not a cursor save: a pair with `left <
//!   right` (a left of 0 is 1; a right absent, 0 or past the screen is the
//!   last column) sets the margins and homes the cursor, any other pair
//!   changes nothing; resetting DECLRMM puts the margins back to the full
//!   width and leaves the cursor, and RIS and a resize reset them too (a
//!   resize keeps the mode). Inside the margins they bound what xterm bounds:
//!   a glyph wraps at the right margin onto the left one (from left of the
//!   left margin too; from past the right one at the screen's edge), CR goes
//!   to the left margin (to column 0 from left of it, but always to the margin
//!   under origin mode), CUF and TAB stop at the right margin and CUB and BS
//!   at the left one unless the cursor is already beyond it, and IRM, ICH and
//!   DCH shift only up to the right margin. Every scroll (LF/IND/NEL at the
//!   bottom margin, RI at the top one, SU/SD, IL/DL and a wrap) moves only
//!   the rectangle between the margins, the cells beside it stay; an index
//!   or reverse index from a cursor outside the margins is a plain cursor
//!   motion that the scrolling region stops, and ICH, DCH, IL and DL there
//!   change nothing, a pending wrap included (xterm returns before
//!   `ResetWrap`). Under origin mode CUP/HVP and CHA count columns from the
//!   left margin and stop at the right one, VPA keeps the column so counted,
//!   and a restored cursor stops at the right margin. ED, EL and ECH ignore
//!   the margins, as in xterm. A wrap pending on a right margin short of the
//!   last column is its own state (DECSC saves it, DECRC puts it back
//!   wherever the column lands, as xterm's `do_wrap = sc->wrap_flag`; a TAB
//!   keeps it and, where the line runs on past that column, as after a DECLRMM
//!   reset, carries it to the next stop), reported by [`Screen::cursor`] one
//!   past that column as at the screen's edge and told apart by
//!   [`Screen::wrap_pending`]. One deliberate difference: a TAB from
//!   past the right margin runs to the screen's edge, where xterm pulls the
//!   cursor back onto the margin.
//! * **Origin mode** is xterm's `ORIGIN` flag read through `CursorSet`
//!   (cursor.c): setting or resetting `?6` homes the cursor (to the top margin
//!   when set), CUP/HVP and VPA count rows from the top margin and stop at the
//!   bottom one, CHA keeps the cursor's row counted from the top margin
//!   (`CursorRow`, never below 0), and DECSTBM homes to the top margin. A
//!   restored cursor is `CursorSet` from the restored flags: under origin mode
//!   its row stops at the bottom margin, not the top one. DECSC saves the
//!   flag (`DECSC_FLAGS` holds `ORIGIN`), a restore of a slot never saved
//!   clears it, and RIS clears it.
//! * **Insert mode** (IRM, the ANSI mode 4) shifts the rest of the line right
//!   before each glyph lands, as xterm's `WriteText` runs `InsertChar` first;
//!   what passes the last column is lost. **Newline mode** (LNM, ANSI mode
//!   20) makes LF, VT and FF return the carriage after the line feed, as
//!   xterm's `CASE_VMOT` does under `LINEFEED` (IND and NEL are untouched).
//!   DECSC saves neither mode; RIS clears both.
//! * **SU/SD** (`CSI n S`, `CSI n T`) scroll the region up or down `n` lines
//!   (xterm `xtermScroll`/`RevScroll`) wherever the cursor is, never move it,
//!   and keep a pending wrap; lines scrolled in take the bce blank. As in
//!   xterm's `CASE_TRACK_MOUSE`, only a lone nonzero (or defaulted) parameter
//!   is SD: `CSI 0 T` and a `T` with more than one parameter start highlight
//!   mouse tracking, which the fold consumes with no effect.
//! * **Character sets**: G0 and G1, each ASCII (`ESC ( B`, `ESC ) B`) or DEC
//!   Special Graphics (`ESC ( 0`, `ESC ) 0`, xterm's table in
//!   [`dec_special_graphic`]), with SO/SI mapping G1/G0 into GL; a byte in
//!   `0x20..=0x7E` paints the glyph GL's set gives it, and a decoded UTF-8
//!   character paints itself. DECSC saves the sets and the shift, a restore
//!   of a slot never saved resets them (xterm `resetCharsets`: ASCII in G0
//!   and G1, G0 in GL), and RIS resets them. G2/G3, single shifts, the
//!   national and 96-character sets are not modelled: their designations
//!   are consumed and change nothing.
//! * **East Asian wide characters** take two cells: a lead ([`Cell::width`] 2)
//!   holding the glyph and a spacer after it (width 0) that carries the same
//!   rendition (xterm's `HIDDEN_CHAR`, Ghostty's `spacer_tail`). A character is
//!   wide when Unicode's East Asian Width calls it Wide or Fullwidth and it
//!   takes a column at all, and a regional indicator is wide too
//!   ([`is_wide_char`]): [`char_display_width`] measures each codepoint alone,
//!   as aterm measures it, its zero-width set ([`is_combining_mark`]) included,
//!   so U+302A..U+302D, U+3099/U+309A and U+16FE4, marks that East Asian Width
//!   calls Wide, take no column (xterm's combining table, Ghostty, aterm). A
//!   wide glyph with one column left before the line end (the right margin, or
//!   the screen's edge from past it) wraps first, and the column it skips takes
//!   the bce blank, as aterm, Ghostty (`spacer_head`) and Alacritty
//!   (`LEADING_WIDE_CHAR_SPACER`) blank it; xterm's `dotext` alone leaves that
//!   cell as it was. A wrap pending after a wide glyph sits on its spacer. On a
//!   screen one column wide a wide glyph prints as a narrow space in the pen,
//!   as aterm and Ghostty print it (xterm's `dotext` gives up on the glyph,
//!   and on any narrow glyph it read with it in the same pass, then prints
//!   what follows).
//!   **No operation leaves half a wide glyph.** A write, an erase, ICH, DCH and
//!   IRM that would cut one (xterm repairs its `DamagedCells` with
//!   `ClearCells`, Ghostty calls `splitCellBoundary`) first blank both of its
//!   cells with the bce blank, one straddling the right margin included; a
//!   scroll between left/right margins first turns each glyph straddling a
//!   margin into two narrow blanks that keep their renditions and lose their
//!   marks (Ghostty's `rowWillBeShifted` with `clearGrapheme`; xterm leaves the
//!   halves torn); a narrowing resize that cuts a spacer off leaves its lead a
//!   default blank.
//! * **Grapheme clusters, in part**: a zero-width code point
//!   ([`is_combining_mark`]: a combining mark, a variation selector, the
//!   zero-width (non-)joiner or another format control) attaches, up to
//!   [`MAX_COMBINING`] per cell, onto the preceding glyph on the row (the lead
//!   of a wide one, or the current cell at column 0 / left margin) without
//!   advancing the cursor, and so does a glyph aterm joins to the cluster
//!   before it: a skin-tone modifier after a wide glyph, the second regional
//!   indicator of a flag, and a glyph other than ASCII after an attached
//!   `U+200D`. aterm goes further (a VS16 widens a narrow emoji base and a VS15
//!   narrows a wide one, a skin-tone modifier joins only an emoji modifier
//!   base, and a mark at column 0 of a wrapped row joins the glyph that ends
//!   the row above); the fold models none of that, and aterm's differential
//!   oracle generates none of it.
//! * DECSC/DECRC save and restore the cursor position (with a pending wrap)
//!   and the SGR rendition, as xterm's `CursorSave`/`CursorRestore` do; a
//!   restore from a slot never saved homes the cursor and resets the
//!   rendition (xterm's zeroed `SavedCursor`). Origin mode is saved with them
//!   (above), and so are the character sets (below). There is no
//!   scrollback, so `ED 3` (xterm's
//!   "erase saved lines", `do_erase_display` case 3) changes nothing here: the
//!   visible screen is not saved lines.
//! * **Resize clips/extends**; it does not reflow wrapped lines. A wrap pending at the edge
//!   (`col == cols`) keeps its next write, the column after the glyph: a widening leaves the
//!   cursor there and a narrowing leaves it waiting on the new edge. A cursor whose own cell a
//!   narrowing cuts off is clamped onto the last column with no wrap, as xterm clamps it, and a
//!   wrap pending at a right margin stays pending on its column, clipped to the new width
//!   (aterm's `resize-keeps-the-next-write` without reflow, which aterm's differential VT oracle
//!   holds both engines to). A DECSC slot stays where it was saved.
//! * Grid dimensions are clamped to `1..=`[`MAX_DIM`] so hostile input cannot
//!   trigger an unbounded allocation (panic-free, like `astream-wire`).
