//! A read-only, keyed view of a tape's reply doors.
//!
//! [`ReplaySeam`](crate::ReplaySeam) answers in order and consumes as it goes:
//! the right shape for re-running the recorded program, the wrong one for
//! asking a recorded question out of order. A second reader — a candidate
//! decision function re-deciding a recorded point, a "why did it do that"
//! report — needs "what had the door `probe.git_view` answered to THIS request
//! once the program had read N records?" without disturbing the replay that
//! drives the program, and without depending on the order in which it asks. [`KeyedView`] is that
//! reader: it makes every [`Exchange`](crate::EffectRecord::Exchange) available by
//! (door, request), and each [`lookup`](KeyedView::lookup) is a pure
//! function of the tape and its arguments.
//!
//! [`KeyedIndex`] is the same index over records it HOLDS — a `Vec`, a `Box`
//! or an `Arc` of them — for a reader that asks from many places and cannot
//! keep a borrow of the tape alive across them: every look of every decision
//! re-decided on one tape, each made through its own `'static` handle, asks one
//! index built once (behind an `Arc`), where a [`KeyedView`] would have to be
//! built again from the whole tape for each look. Both answer through the one
//! search below, so they cannot disagree.
