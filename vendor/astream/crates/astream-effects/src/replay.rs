//! The REPLAY pass: re-feed the recorded tape, touching NO real effect.
//!
//! ## Formal Verification (`clean` Island — TLA+ Deterministic Effect Replay)
//!
//! This module embeds a machine-checked Clean specification (`Astream.Effects.TlaDeterministicReplay`)
//! of the deterministic effect-tape replay protocol:
//! - Every effect request (`Clock`, `Rand`, `File`) advances the replay cursor only when
//!   `diverged = false`, `cursor < tapeLen`, and both the effect kind and path match the
//!   recorded tape entry.
//! - Exhaustion (`cursor = tapeLen`), kind mismatch, or path divergence transitions to the
//!   fail-closed `diverged = true` state without advancing `cursor`, proving
//!   `Spec n ⊨ □ (Lift ReplaySafetyInv)` (`cursor <= tapeLen /\ matchedPrefix = cursor`).

/// The reply and flag doors are different, and this says so rather than

/// argument of [`exchange`](EffectSeam::exchange) and
/// [`raised`](EffectSeam::raised), handed to this seam like any other, and no
/// type stops an implementation from calling it. This one never does: both
/// methods bind the closure to `_`, so calling it takes an edit to the
/// signature a reviewer sees, and every replay test runs with closures that
/// panic if called (`tests/suite/exchange_replay.rs`, which also catches a replay
/// that falls back to the live world when the tape ends). So for the doors
/// that reach the outside world, "replay never calls `live`" is a property
/// this implementation keeps and its tests hold it to — inspected, not
/// structural.
///
/// A kind mismatch, a diverged path, door, request or output, or an exhausted
/// tape is refused with a [`ReplayDivergence`], so the program stops rather
/// than silently reading the real world.

/// still names the record the program could not take and
/// [`peek`](ReplaySeam::peek) still shows it, which is what a report of "the
/// first divergence, at record N" reads.
///
/// The tape is any iterator of records — an in-memory [`EffectsLog`]
