//! The broker daemon: a thread-per-connection server over a Unix-domain socket or TCP
//! (plaintext; AEAD-sealed with the `aead` feature; capability-guarded with the `cap`
//! feature), one `Mutex<BrokerLog>` + `Condvar` for the single-writer log and live
//! tail, and a group-commit writer thread that every durable mutation funnels through.
//!
//! Lock discipline (the crux): the log `Mutex` is held ONLY for staging/committing a
//! batch (incl. its fsync) or a short catch-up pointer copy — NEVER across a socket
//! write, a follower round-trip, or a `Condvar` wait. So a slow/dead consumer (or
//! follower) blocks only its own thread, never other consumers. The tail wakes via
//! `Condvar` (no sleeps, no poll); the wait predicate reads the visible `head` under
//! the same lock the writer advances it under, so a commit landing between "caught up"
//! and "wait" is never missed.
//!
//! Lifecycle: the acceptor polls a non-blocking listener and the `running` flag.
//! Shutdown flips the flag, force-closes every registered connection socket (a thread
//! parked in a socket read/write returns at once), joins the acceptor and the writer,
//! then releases the log's file lock. A `Broker` dropped without ever serving stops
//! its own writer thread.

/// reconsidered it — and because the reader's paired `Subscribe { from: mark.next }`
/// starts at H3, the record that superseded it was never delivered either. The stale
/// row was permanent and silent.
///
/// WHAT THE PIN COSTS, DELIBERATELY. `last_matching` decides a subject from
/// `self.last` — its LATEST offset — and skips it entirely when that offset is not
/// below `visible`. So a subject whose newest record moves to or above the pinned head
/// mid-walk, and that the walk has not yet reached, is OMITTED from the page rather
/// than returned at its older value; reading it at its value as of the pin would need
/// a backward walk from `visible` that the store exposes no call for. This is the same
/// fail-closed direction the Replicated tier already takes for a record above the
/// quorum watermark, and here it loses nothing: the answer's `Mark.next` IS the pinned
/// head, so the record that displaced the omitted subject is delivered on the reader's
/// `Subscribe { from: mark.next }`. An omitted subject is filled in by the tail; a
/// stale row was not.
///
/// THE PIN IS PER REQUEST. Client-driven paging (`Mark.resume` into the next `Last`)
/// pins a fresh head per page, so a paged reader still has to fold newest-wins across
/// its pages and tail from the FIRST page's `next`, exactly as `Client::last` says.
///
/// THE CURSOR NEVER NAMES A SUBJECT THE FILTER DOES NOT MATCH. `last_matching` walks
/// the ordered subject index from the filter's LITERAL PREFIX (`/f/F/in/*/*/n-1/*` ->
/// `/f/F/in/`) and reports the last entry it VISITED, matched or not. When the page is
/// cut by `max` that entry always matched, so it is inside whatever grant contained the
/// filter; when it is cut by the SCAN bound it is whatever the walk happened to stop
/// on, which under a literal prefix as broad as `/f/F/in/` is routinely another node's,
/// another session's, another human's inbox lane. Putting that on the wire handed a
/// scoped reader one out-of-grant subject NAME per over-scanned page — and in this
/// fabric provenance is the address, so names are the roster.
///
/// So a page cut by the scan bound on a non-matching entry is CONTINUED here, from that
/// cursor, until the walk either finds enough matches or runs the prefix range out. The
/// lock is dropped between rounds, which is the property `LAST_SCAN_MAX` exists for —
/// no single acquisition visits more than `LAST_SCAN_MAX` entries, and ingest is never
/// stalled by a sparse filter. What a client can pay for is more CPU across rounds, and
/// [`LAST_RESUME_ROUNDS`] bounds that; past it the answer is an error rather than a
/// cursor it is not entitled to (blanking the cursor is not available: an empty
