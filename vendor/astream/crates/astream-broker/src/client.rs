///   the bound instead of after the OS's SYN-retry schedule. The bound is per address,
///   and name resolution is not bounded (std's resolver has no timeout): an IP-literal
///   endpoint makes it a hard bound.
/// - **Sealed / handshake**: the bound also REPLACES the built-in deadline on the
///   transport's handshake I/O (5 s sealed, 10 s key agreement), so a peer that accepts
///   and never answers the hello costs `connect_timeout`, not the default.
/// - **Unix**: not applied. std has no bounded Unix-socket connect; a local connect
///   fails at once when nothing listens, and can park only while a LIVE listener's
///   accept backlog is full.
///
/// `None` is exactly each transport's own constructor — [`Client::connect`],
/// [`Client::connect_tcp`], `Client::connect_tcp_sealed`,
/// `Client::connect_tcp_handshake` — including their built-in handshake deadlines.
