//! The retained records' RESIDENCY TIER: which committed records a [`BrokerLog`] keeps
//! decoded in memory, and where on the log file every one of them starts.
//!
//! Before this module the log held EVERY retained record decoded in RAM
//! (`records: Vec<Arc<BrokerRecord>>`) for its whole open, so a broker's resident
//! memory grew with everything it had ever been sent and not yet compacted away: a
//! fleet left running for days paid for its whole history in RAM, though readers
//! almost always want the newest records (a live tail, a resume a little behind it).
//!
//! The tier keeps every retained record's summary in PAGES of [`PAGE`] records
//! (`docs/DESIGN-aterm-fabric.md` §14, open question 8, part c). A page holds where its
//! first record's frame starts and the broker time (`bt=`) of its first record that has
//! one, and the ids of the subjects its records name; four column vectors, indexed as the
//! slots were, hold an entry a record: its frame start and its broker time as `u32`s from
//! its page's, its plaintext-frame bytes with the has-time and hidden flags, and its subject
//! as a `u8` index into its page's ids. That is 13 bytes a record where the slot vector
//! before it (`tier_reference.rs`) took 24, in four allocations rather than one a page, and
//! every answer is the slot's: a record's frame start is one column read from its page's,
//! so a cold read is still one frame. A value no column can hold (a frame start or broker time
//! below its page's first, or `u32::MAX` or more past it) is kept whole in a map by the
//! record's offset; a log's frames are contiguous and a page spans at most 255 of them, so
//! no frame start of a real log goes there. A record's offset is not stored: record `i` is
//! offset `base + i`, which every reader of the tier relies on.
//!
//! With a finite byte budget ([`Tier::with_budget`]), the tier keeps DECODED records only
//! for a hot window at the head; the newest always stays, even when it exceeds the budget.
//! The budget does not bound the pages or other broker memory, which grow with history. A
//! record outside the window is read from its frame on demand
//! ([`BrokerLog::record_arc`](crate::BrokerLog)), through the same frame decode, at-rest open
//! and record parse the open's recovery scan applies, so a cold read returns exactly the
//! record the open would have recovered.
//!
//! WHAT IS NEVER EVICTED: a record nothing has made durable is never written cold,
//! because every record the tier holds was promoted by a write that put its frame at
//! its recorded position first (`commit_end`, `append_frame`, the open's scan, the
//! retention rewrite). Positions are therefore always valid for the file the log
//! currently holds. A retention rewrite replaces the file and rebuilds the tier with
//! the new positions in the same step.
//!
//! The default budget is unbounded ([`Tier::RESIDENT_ALL`]), which is exactly the old
//! behaviour; an embedder opts into a bound through `OpenOptions`.
