//! `BrokerLog` — the broker's durable message log: a TIERED (Strict / Relaxed)
//! group-commit log with exactly-once ingest and durable consumer-group commits.
//!
//! Ports the atomic-append rollback and recover-on-open discipline from
//! `astream_engine::store`/`durable` (longest intact in-order prefix) and tightens
//! it: only a TORN TAIL — an incomplete trailing frame, or a zero-filled tail, the
//! signatures of an interrupted write — is truncated on open. A complete-but-corrupt
//! frame, a record-format (`BREC_VERSION`) mismatch, or an offset gap FOLLOWED BY MORE
//! BYTES is corruption, and [`BrokerLog::open_with`] refuses to open rather than
//! silently truncating what may be acked data ([`BrokerLog::open_repair`] is the
//! explicit, data-losing repair). Adds exactly-once **ingest**: a `(producer_id,
//! producer_seq)` idempotency key maps to the original `Offset`, so a re-sent publish
//! is NOT re-appended and returns the offset it first got — the precise pair, NOT the
//! engine's monotonic high-water (which would wrongly reject a producer legitimately
//! re-sending an old seq after a crash). The dedup map and the offset spine are
//! rebuilt from the stored bytes on open, so exactly-once survives a broker restart.
//!
//! The broker's hot path is GROUP COMMIT (`stage_*` + `BrokerLog::commit_batch`):
//! a batch of records is written, then ONE fsync (Strict) or none (Relaxed) covers
//! it. The per-record `publish` / `commit` / `process_and_produce` methods are the
//! un-batched equivalents with the same tier semantics. An open log holds an
//! EXCLUSIVE advisory lock on its file, so two brokers can never serve one log.
