//! `ShardedBroker` — share-nothing partition sharding (the doctrine's §4.2
//! thread-per-core architecture). N **independent** single-partition brokers, each its
//! own durable log + writer thread + group commit + pipelining, with NO shared lock
//! across shards — so write throughput scales with cores/disks instead of serializing
//! on one writer.
//!
//! Routing is the canonical [`astream_wire::assign_partition`] over the subject, so
//! every record for a subject lands in ONE shard and a subject's order is preserved.
//! The trade-off, stated honestly: ordering is **per-partition**, NOT a global total
//! order across shards (offsets are per-shard) — the same model Kafka uses. The single
//! [`Broker`] remains the globally-ordered option; `ShardedBroker` trades global order
//! for scale.
//!
//! Because routing is a pure function of `(subject, shard count)`, the shard count is
//! part of the data's identity: reopening a directory with a different count would
//! strand the extra shards' acked records and route a subject's new records away from
//! its history. So the count is PERSISTED — a `shards` sidecar file in the log
//! directory, written on first open — and every later open, and every client connect
//! against the socket directory (which gets the same sidecar on `serve`), is validated
//! against it; a mismatch is refused.
//!
//! Each shard is a full [`Broker`], so every per-shard guarantee (exactly-once ingest,
//! Strict durability + crash recovery, group commit, pipelining, fork/cognition verbs)
//! holds within a shard unchanged.
//!
//! HONEST throughput note (measured, `broker_sharded_bench`): on a SINGLE disk at
//! Strict durability, sharding does NOT increase aggregate throughput and can reduce
//! it — one optimally-batched log is already disk-fsync-bound, so splitting a fixed
//! producer set across N shards just fragments group-commit batching across N fsync
//! streams contending for the one disk. Sharding is a HORIZONTAL-SCALE architecture: it
//! pays off across multiple disks/nodes, or in a CPU/lock-bound regime (e.g. the
//! `Relaxed` tier, where there is no per-message fsync and the single writer thread —
//! not the disk — is the bottleneck). The single-node single-disk throughput wins are
//! group commit + pipelining (both measured). We do NOT claim a sharding throughput
//! win we cannot show; this module's evidence is its routing/ordering/recovery
//! CORRECTNESS (`broker.sharded-routing`).
