//! CRASH-SAFE, STREAMING COMPACTION: the retention rewrite of the durable log, done in an
//! order an open can recover from at any point, copied in bounded chunks, and split so
//! the bulk of the copy runs with no lock held (`REQUIREMENTS-fabric-operations` R4,
//! "Design (2026-10-19)").
//!
//! # The protocol
//!
//! A compaction to `min` keeps the records at offsets `min..` and drops the ones below.
//! Beside the log at `<log>` it writes:
//!
//! | file | holds | written by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `<log>.kept` | the kept suffix, frame bytes as stored | the unlocked copy and its flush, then the delta and its flush |
//! | `<log>.state.next` | the carried state at the new base (a carrying compaction) | tmp + flush + rename |
//! | `<log>.compact` | the INTENT: both bases, the old first frame's identity and the new one's | tmp + flush + rename |
//!
//! All three hold the log's records or bytes of them, so each is created with the log's
//! own permissions, set exactly past the umask (`create_like`).
//!
//! Its durable steps, in order, each a crash point of the [`Seam`]:
//!
//! 0. [`Step::Held`]: a log the retention rules retain (`retention.rs`) has its held
//!    store's frames for this compaction appended to `<log>.held` and flushed, each naming
//!    the new base, before anything else is written (`held.rs`). An open that finds them
//!    while the log's base is still the old one cuts them away: the records they carry are
//!    still in the log.
//! 1. [`Step::Copy`]: `<log>.kept` holds every byte of the log from the cut, flushed.
//! 2. [`Step::State`]: `<log>.state.next` is durable (a carrying compaction only).
//! 3. [`Step::Intent`]: `<log>.compact` is durable.
//! 4. [`Step::Rename`]: `<log>.kept` is renamed over `<log>`, and the directory flushed.
//! 5. [`Step::StateInstalled`]: `<log>.state.next` is renamed over `<log>.state`.
//! 6. [`Step::Base`]: `<log>.base` holds the new base.
//! 7. [`Step::Watermark`]: the anti-rollback watermark names the new first frame and base
//!    (an anti-rollback log only).
//! 8. [`Step::IntentRemoved`]: `<log>.compact` is gone.
//!
//! # Recovery
//!
//! An open ([`recover`]) that finds an intent compares its two identities with the log's
//! own first frame. The NEW one: the rename happened, so the open finishes steps 5 to 8,
//! each idempotent. The OLD one: it did not, so the open discards the intent, the copy
//! and the staged state, since the log, its base, its state and its watermark were never
//! touched. Neither: the log is not the one the intent was written for, and the open
//! refuses, touching nothing. With no intent, a copy or a staged state that a compaction
//! left when it died before writing its intent is removed. Before this protocol a crash
//! between the rename and the base write left a log whose first record disagreed with
//! its base, which every open refused, recoverable only from a backup.
//!
//! # Off the ack path
//!
//! Durable bytes are append-only: below the durable length nothing rewrites the file but a
//! compaction, and compactions are serialized. So [`KeptCopy::run`] copies
//! `[cut, the durable length when the compaction began)` and FLUSHES it with no lock held,
//! while the broker's writer commits batches, and the locked finish copies and flushes only
//! what was appended since ([`KeptCopy::extend_to`], [`KeptCopy::flush`]) before it switches
//! the files. The finish's other durable writes (the staged state, the intent, the switch)
//! are each a few bytes and a flush.
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! The copy reads through one buffer of [`COMPACT_CHUNK`] bytes, plus the two frames it
//! must hold whole for their identities (the log's first and the kept suffix's first):
//! never the log.
