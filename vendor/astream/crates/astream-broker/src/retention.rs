//! RETENTION CLASSES: the rules a broker retains its log by, and the pure planning they
//! take (`REQUIREMENTS-fabric-operations` R4, "Design (2026-10-19)").
//!
//! # The rules
//!
//! A broker's retention is a list of [`Rule`]s, each `(filter, class, max_age, max_bytes)`,
//! plus a DEFAULT rule for every subject no rule names ([`Retention`]). A subject belongs to
//! the first rule whose filter matches it, and a broker-internal (hidden) subject to the
//! default rule, which counts its bytes and never holds it (its bindings, wills and group
//! commits are carried in `<log>.state`). A broker with no rules never compacts by itself.
//!
//! There are two classes:
//!
//! - **prefix**: exactly one rule, the bulk stream (`/f/<F>/pub/*/*/ev` in a fabric). It
//!   alone holds the CUT, the log's new base, down to the oldest record it still wants: the
//!   newest records of its class within its `max_bytes`, none older than its `max_age`.
//!   Below the cut its records are gone, so its floor is the base.
//! - **hold**: every other rule, the default one included. A hold rule never holds the cut
//!   back. Below the cut, each record a hold rule still wants is carried, by its absolute
//!   offset, in the held store (`held.rs`): one that keeps ALL ([`Keep::All`]) wants every
//!   record within its `max_age` that its readers have not read ([`Rule::until_read`]); one
//!   that keeps the LAST value only ([`Keep::Last`]) wants nothing beyond each subject's
//!   `Last` row, which every compaction carries in `<log>.state` whatever the rules.
//!
//! # Every class bounded
//!
//! A class's bytes are its records' in the retained suffix plus its held ones. A class past
//! its own `max_bytes` gives up its oldest: a hold class drops its oldest held records, and
//! when its records above the cut alone are past it, the cut rises to put the oldest of them
//! below, where they are dropped instead of carried. So a hold rule never holds the cut back
//! (one held mail cannot pin every subject's records, which a cut that is the minimum over
//! every rule's floor would), and the retained and held record bytes together stay within
//! the sum of the rules' `max_bytes`, plus what the log took since the planning: broker RAM
//! follows the rules, beside the `Last` rows the subject caps bound
//! ([`MAX_SUBJECTS_PER_PRODUCER`](crate::store::MAX_SUBJECTS_PER_PRODUCER)).
//!
//! A class past its bytes gives up AT LEAST A QUARTER of them ([`SLACK_DIV`]), its oldest,
//! or down to its bytes when it is further past them than that: so a class that has just
//! given records up has a quarter of its bytes of room, less what it was past them by,
//! before it is past them again. A cut
//! copies the log it keeps, so without that room a log at its bounds would be copied whole
//! for every batch it took; with it, a class's records ask for a cut at most once a quarter
//! of its bytes. A log far past its bounds keeps exactly its bytes (R4's acceptance: 100 of
//! 250 records, the oldest 151).
//!
//! The broker's writer asks for a tick when a batch takes SOME CLASS past the room the last
//! planning left it (`Plan::room`), counted by the class of each record it takes, never by
//! the log's length: a class at its bytes while another class's records arrive asks for
//! nothing until a record of its own does.
//!
//! # Told, never silent
//!
//! A record a [`Keep::All`] hold rule gave up (past its bytes or its age, or read by every
//! reader it names) raises its SUBJECT's floor past it; a `Fetch` below the floor of what
//! its filter can match answers `ERR retained-from=<floor>` (`proto::RETAINED_FROM_PREFIX`)
//! instead of an empty page, and a record given up while still unread is logged, one line
//! per subject and count. Records of one subject are given up oldest first (bytes and age
//! take the oldest, and a group that read a record read every older one of its filter), so a
//! subject's floor never passes a record of it the store still holds. `oldest` is that
//! floor for a filter, the offset at and above which the filter is complete: the base for
//! what the prefix rule and the last-value rules can match, the matching subjects' floors
//! (and where the rules took effect) for the rest, the greatest of them over what the
//! filter matches. So of a filter whose subjects have different floors, records some subject
//! still holds can lie below it.
//!
//! A TAIL is told too (R4's addendum, A9): one whose cursor is below its filter's oldest is
//! sent a gap notice before its next record, counted from the `Ledger` of what the hold
//! rules gave up where that names every record of the filter it lost (`counted_from`), and
//! is delivered every record of its filter retention still holds there. A `Fetch` from a
//! reader that asked for the notices reads the same way (`BrokerLog::fetch_told`): below the
//! oldest, while retention still holds records of its filter there, it reads them from its
//! `from`, the notice ahead of the page; `retained-from=` is the answer when it holds none of
//! them, and to a reader that did not ask.
//!
//! # Record times
//!
//! The log's records carry no time. The retention tick STAMPS what it has not seen yet with
//! its own clock (`stamp`): a record's age is measured from the first tick that saw it, so it
//! reads at most one tick younger than it is, never older. The stamps are DURABLE: each job
//! writes the ones its tick took into the held store (`held.rs`, its `S` frames), so a
//! reopen reads every record's age back, and an age rule cuts by when a record was first
//! seen whatever the restarts between (a record no tick saw before a restart is stamped at
//! the first tick after it, a restart's downtime younger). A crash that loses records a tick
//! stamped cuts the stamps back to the log's head at the open (`clamp_stamps`), so a record
//! that takes a lost one's offset is never read as old as it. Held records keep their own
//! stamp in the held store. Every age decision is the tick's, taken at the time it is handed
//! (`Broker::retention_tick_at`), so a test drives it with a hand clock and nothing reads
//! the wall clock here.
