//! `asb` — a thin CLI over the astream broker, so any language or shell can put
//! bytes on the bus, tail them, read retained state, and drain an inbox. Every
//! verb is a direct pass-through to the claim-tested [`astream_broker`] library,
//! over a Unix socket or (with `--tcp`) TCP:
//!
//! ```text
//! asb serve  <endpoint> [<log>] [--tcp] [--secret-file PATH] [--unix SOCKET]
//!                                                           run a broker; prints `listening <bound>`
//! asb pub    <endpoint> <subject> [--id N] [--seq M]        publish stdin's bytes; prints `<offset> new|dup`
//! asb sub    <endpoint> <filter> [--from N | --group G]     tail as `<offset> <nbytes>\n<bytes>\n`
//! asb last   <endpoint> <filter> [--after S] [--max N]      last record per subject, then `MARK next= head=`
//! asb fetch  <endpoint> <filter> [--from N] [--max M]       a bounded, non-tailing read, then `MARK`
//! asb drain  <endpoint> <group> <filter> [--max N] [--idle MS] [--peek]
//! asb ack    <endpoint> <group> <offset> <subject> handled|refused|deferred
//! asb commit <endpoint> <group> <upto>                      durably commit a consumer group
//! asb mint   <grant> --secret-env NAME | --secret-file PATH mint a capability line
//! asb repair <log>                                          truncate at the first corrupt record
//! ```
//!
//! `commit`'s printed `<offset>` is the COMMIT RECORD's own log offset, NOT
//! `<upto>` and not the group's committed offset: the two live in different
//! spaces, so never resume a consumer from it — resume with `sub --group G`.
//!
//! `commit`'s `<upto>` and `ack`'s `<offset>` must name a record the broker HAS: both
//! are checked against its visible head first, and an operand at or past it is a usage
//! error (exit 2, nothing durable done). A consumer group's committed offset is
//! MONOTONE by construction — no asb verb and no broker request lowers it — so
//! `asb commit <ep> G 999999` used to exit 0 printing `<offset> committed` and durably
//! skip G past every record it had not read, with no recovery but a new group name.
//! That check is why `commit` also requires `<group>` to be subject-shaped: a guarded
//! broker already does (a group name is a subject the ring must grant), and the head
//! probe reads under that same name so it is authorized by the same grant the commit
//! is.
//!
//! `<endpoint>` is a socket path, or a `host:port` under `--tcp` (serve accepts
//! `host:0` and prints the OS-chosen port). `sub`'s framing — a header line then
//! exactly `<nbytes>` raw body bytes then a newline — is byte-exact and NUL-safe,
//! the shape a lash/bridge parses to move a terminal's `/out` and `/in`, locally
//! or across a machine boundary.
//!
//! `last`, `fetch` and `drain` print the SUBJECT in the header —
//! `<offset> <nbytes> <subject>\n<body>\n` — where `sub` does not. The reason is
//! the query: those three are wildcard reads over a whole subtree, and a drain
//! that had to guess which subject a record came from could not route it. The
//! COUNT comes BEFORE the subject because the subject is the one field whose
//! bytes a publisher chooses: the wire rejects a control byte in a subject but
//! NOT a space, so `<offset> <subject> <nbytes>` could be spoofed by publishing
//! to `/f/F/in/evil 999` and desynchronizing every consumer that splits the
//! header on spaces. With the two numeric fields first the parse is exact — read
//! `<offset>`, read `<nbytes>`, and the SUBJECT IS THE REST OF THE LINE (never
//! empty, always `/`-leading, and newline-free by the wire's own grammar) — so no
//! subject can fake a header. `last` and `fetch` then print
//! `MARK next=<n> head=<h>`. `next` means a DIFFERENT thing in each: for `fetch` it
//! is the page cursor — the offset after the last record SCANNED — so `--from
//! <next>` reaches the rest, and `next` below `head` means there is more. For `last`
//! it is the head itself, the offset to `sub --from` to tail on from this answer, and
//! NOT a page cursor. `last` pages by SUBJECT instead: `--max` bounds the ROW COUNT,
//! a page shorter than `--max` — an empty one included — ends the subject walk, and a
//! full page continues with `--after <the last subject printed>`.
//!
//! WHAT `last`'s MARK IS, AND IS NOT. For `fetch`, `head` is the subscriber-visible
//! head that one request was answered at. For `last` it is not quite that, and the
//! difference is worth two paragraphs. ONE `Last` request is a snapshot: the broker
//! pins the visible head on its first scan round and reads every later round against
//! that pinned value. But asb follows the broker's resume cursor past its internal row
//! and index-scan bounds (below), so one `asb last` can be SEVERAL requests, each
//! pinning its own, LATER head. The printed `next`/`head` is the FIRST request's — the
//! lowest of them — because that is the only offset a paired `sub --from <next>` can
//! start at with no gap: from any later head, a record that superseded a value an
//! earlier request already printed would never be delivered. So the printed answer is
//! a UNION of per-request snapshots reported under the first one's head, not one
//! snapshot read at that head, and a row from a later request may carry an offset AT
//! OR ABOVE the printed `head`. Fold newest-wins when you tail from `next`, exactly as
//! a client paging `Last` by hand must.
//!
//! AND A SHORT `last` PAGE HAS TWO CAUSES, NOT ONE. Following the resume cursor takes
//! the broker's row and index-scan limits out of the answer: neither of those can
//! truncate it silently any more. The head pin has a cost that stays, deliberately.
//! The broker decides each subject from its LATEST offset and skips it entirely when
//! that offset is not below the pinned head, so a subject the walk has not reached yet
//! whose newest record lands at or above that head is OMITTED from the page rather
//! than returned at its older value — fail-closed, the direction the Replicated tier
//! already takes above the quorum watermark. At the broker that costs nothing: the
//! answer's `next` IS the pinned head, so the record that displaced the omitted
//! subject arrives on the reader's paired `sub --from <next>`. `asb last` ALONE does
//! not make that read — it prints rows and a MARK and exits — so on the shell face the
//! omission is real and invisible: the row count is one lower, `--max` was not
//! reached, and nothing says why. THE WHOLE ANSWER IS `--max` PLUS `sub --from
//! <next>`, never `--max` alone. A fleet roster read out of `asb last` on its own can
//! be one live node short.
//!
//! Durable resume for a shell consumer: `asb sub <ep> <filter> --group G` resumes
//! from the group's durable committed offset (`upto + 1`, or 0 if never
//! committed) and `asb commit <ep> G <upto>` advances it after the record at
//! `upto` has been acted on — so a restarted consumer never re-processes history.
//! `asb drain` is the batched form of that pair, and `asb ack` is the atomic
//! read-process-write form: the answer record and the cursor advance in ONE
//! durable append, deduped by the input offset, so a retried ack appends nothing.
//!
//! `ack` publishes under the producer sequence `2^63 | <input offset>`, and
//! `pub` refuses a `--seq` at or above `2^63`: the TOP HALF of the producer
//! sequence space is RESERVED for acks. Under one bound grant `pub` and `ack`
//! share a single producer id (the grant permits no other), and the broker dedups
//! on `(producer_id, producer_seq)` — so a `pub --seq-file` counter (1, 2, 3, …)
//! and an early input offset would otherwise be the SAME dedup key, and whichever
//! arrived second would be swallowed: nothing appended, no cursor moved, `dup`
//! printed, exit 0. Reserving a half makes the two spaces disjoint by
//! construction, and a retried ack still dedups because its sequence is a
//! function of the input offset alone.
//!
//! The reservation is NOT asb's alone: `ACK_SEQ_BASE` is exported from the library
//! and `astream_broker::ack` derives the same `ACK_SEQ_BASE | offset` key, so an
//! ack retried through the OTHER face — a bridge that shells out here on one path
//! and links the crate on another — is recognised as the retry it is and dedups.
//! That agreement is pinned by `broker.ack-key-is-one-wire-contract`.
//!
//! HONEST BOUNDARY — AN UPGRADE IS NOT COMPATIBLE ACROSS THIS CHANGE. Before the
//! two faces were aligned, `astream_broker::ack` keyed on the BARE offset. An ack
//! that a PRE-ALIGNMENT library caller already put on the log therefore sits under
//! `(producer_id, offset)`, and a retry of that same logical ack after the upgrade
//! is keyed `(producer_id, 2^63 | offset)` — a different key, so it appends a
//! second answer record rather than deduping. The dedup map is durable, so no
//! protocol version can catch this: the frames are well-formed, it is the stored
//! key that moved. Drain a log's in-flight acks before upgrading a producer that
//! used the library helper, or accept one duplicated answer per ack that was
//! in doubt across the upgrade (the group commit stays monotone either way).
//!
//! Plain `--tcp` is plaintext (trusted network only). For the XChaCha20-Poly1305-
//! sealed transport (asb built `--features aead`) supply the 32-byte pre-shared
//! key as 64 hex chars through `--key-env NAME` (an environment variable) or
//! `--key-file PATH` — never on argv: a bare `--key HEX` is refused, because argv
//! is visible to every local user via `ps` for the process's whole lifetime.
//!
//! A capability is presented the same way and for the same reason: `--cap-file
//! <path>` (repeatable) reads `<grant> <tag-hex>` lines — exactly what `asb mint`
//! prints — and attaches each of them BEFORE the verb runs. The line is split at its
//! LAST whitespace, not its first, because the wire admits a SPACE inside a filter
//! and so a grant may hold one: the tag is the fixed-width whitespace-free tail, so
//! `ro:/f/F/pub a/> <tag>` reads back as the grant `mint` sealed rather than as a
//! parse error that takes the whole ring down with it. Both the line `mint` prints
//! and the reader are `astream_cap::capfile`'s, so the two cannot disagree.
//! `--cap-filter F --cap-tag HEX` on argv is REFUSED: a capability tag is a secret,
//! and argv is world-readable. The attach is a PROOF OF POSSESSION over the broker's
//! per-connection nonce, so the tag itself never crosses the wire; computing that
//! proof needs the same vetted MAC the broker uses, so `--cap-file` and `mint`
//! need `asb` built with `--features cap`. An unguarded broker acknowledges the
//! attach and enforces nothing.
//!
//! `asb mint` REQUIRES an explicit mode (`ro:` / `rw,p=<principal>:`), and it
//! gates on the PARSED grant, never on its spelling: the read-write grant that
//! names no principal is the UNBOUND god cap — it may publish under any producer
//! id — whether it is written `/f/F/>` or `rw:/f/F/>`, which `Grant::parse` maps
//! to exactly the same authority. Minting either takes `--legacy-unbound`, so a
//! careless mint cannot silently hand out fleet root through the other spelling.
//! When exactly one attached WRITABLE grant names a principal, `pub` and `ack`
//! derive their producer id from it (`astream_cap::producer_id_of`), which is the
//! only id such a grant may publish under. A read-only grant binds nothing (the
//! broker binds nothing for it either), so a `ro,p=<principal>` grant on the ring
//! never chooses the id anything publishes under.
//!
//! A GUARDED BROKER FROM THE CLI. `asb serve --secret-env NAME | --secret-file
//! PATH` opens `Broker::open_guarded` under that mint secret (asb built with
//! `--features cap`): every attach must carry a capability `asb mint` sealed under
//! the same secret, and every request is authorized against the grants attached.
//! Without a secret the broker checks nothing on attach, and a Unix socket's only
//! boundary is the DIRECTORY it sits in. The secret is held to the same rules
//! `mint` reads it under — the same trimming, at least [`SECRET_MIN`] bytes, and a
//! `--secret-file` readable by its owner alone (mode 0600 or tighter), which
//! `serve` also demands of its `--key-file`: a daemon that runs for weeks on a
//! group-readable key has been handing it out the whole time.
//!
//! A TCP LISTENER BINDS LOOPBACK UNLESS TOLD OTHERWISE. `serve` refuses an
//! endpoint that resolves to anything but loopback — `0.0.0.0`, `[::]`, a LAN
//! address — without `--allow-remote`, because a pre-shared key is one secret
//! every host holds (a transport boundary, not a per-host identity) and plain
//! `--tcp` has no boundary at all. `--unix SOCKET` serves a Unix socket AS WELL,
//! from the same broker, log and guard, so the host that serves the network keeps
//! its own clients off the TCP port: the sealed wire admits a bounded number of
//! connections into its handshake at once, and a peer that can reach the port can
//! hold them without the key. A refused bind leaves no empty log behind.
//!
//! Every flag is strict: an unknown `--flag`, a non-numeric `--id/--seq/--from/
//! --max/--idle`, and a flag that does not apply to the verb are usage errors
//! (exit 2) rather than silent defaults, so a mistyped flag can never quietly
//! downgrade a transport or defeat an idempotent retry. Because that strictness
//! catches every dash-leading token, `--` ends flag parsing: each token after it
//! is a positional (the escape for a log path, subject, filter or group that
//! begins with `-`). Argv that is not valid UTF-8 is a usage error too, never a
//! panic.
//!
//! EXIT STATUS, AND ONLY THESE THREE: `0` the verb did what it says; `1` a runtime
//! failure (connect, broker error, a log it cannot open, an I/O error on stdout); `2`
//! a usage error, with nothing written and nothing done. There is no `101`: a write
//! error on stdout or stderr is reported through that contract rather than through a
//! panic, because a supervisor that reads 2 as "bad config, do not retry" and 1 as
//! "transient, retry" can classify a Rust backtrace as neither — and for `pub`, whose
//! default sequence is a fresh timestamp, the retry it guesses at puts the record on
//! the bus a second time. When stdout is gone but stderr is not, a verb that already
//! made a DURABLE change (`pub`, `ack`, `commit`, a `repair` that truncated) repeats
//! what it did on stderr, so the offset is not lost with the pipe. When stderr is gone
//! too, the diagnostic is dropped and the status is the whole message.

  last/fetch/drain print `<offset> <nbytes> <subject>` headers, the SUBJECT running to the end of the line (a

  --from), last's next is the head to sub --from; last pages by SUBJECT (--max bounds the ROWS, a full page
  resumes with --after <the last subject printed>). last's MARK is the FIRST request's -- asb may make several --
  so a printed row can carry an offset at or above the printed head, and a subject superseded past a request's
  pinned head is omitted from its page: the WHOLE answer is --max PLUS a paired `sub --from <next>`
  ack publishes under producer sequence 2^63|<input offset>: the top half of the sequence space is RESERVED for

/// So asb follows the broker's resume cursor here instead of handing back a

/// subject printed>`.
///
/// THE LOOP IS THE LIBRARY'S: [`Client::last_walk`], the one place that knows how a
/// `Last` answer ends. asb hands it `--after` and `--max` as they came — its `max` is a
/// bound on the WHOLE walk's rows and each request asks for exactly the rows still
/// owed, which is the request sequence this function used to make by hand — and prints
/// what it collected only once the walk has ended, so an answer that fails part-way
/// prints no rows at all rather than a prefix that looks finished. The continuation
/// the walk hands back is not printed: on this face it is `--after <the last subject
/// printed>`, which the operator already has.
///
/// WHAT IT IS NOT IS ONE SNAPSHOT. Each `Last` request pins its own visible head
/// (`broker::last_page` pins it on the first round) and reads every scan round of THAT
/// request against it, so one request is a snapshot; the answer this returns is the
/// UNION of `n` of them, each pinned at its own, later head. `next`/`head` are the
/// FIRST request's, never a later one's, because that is the lowest of the pins and so
/// the only one a paired `Subscribe` can start at with no gap — from a later head, a
/// record that superseded a value an earlier request already reported would never be
/// delivered. The consequence a caller must know: A ROW FROM REQUEST 2..n MAY CARRY AN
/// OFFSET AT OR ABOVE THE REPORTED `head`, and the reported head is the safe resume
/// point rather than the head the whole answer was read at. Rows cannot REPEAT across
/// the requests — the cursor is a strictly increasing subject — but a subject may be
/// reported at a value the tail from `next` then supersedes, so a reader that tails
/// must fold newest-wins.
///
/// HONEST BOUNDARY — A SECOND, UNDISCLOSED REASON A PAGE CAN BE SHORT. The pin's
/// deliberate cost is at the store: `last_matching` decides a subject from its LATEST
/// offset and skips it when that offset is not below the pinned head. So a subject
/// whose newest record lands at or above a request's pin before the walk reaches it is
/// OMITTED from that request's page rather than returned at its older value. The
/// broker pays nothing for that because its `Mark.next` IS the pin and the displacing
/// record arrives on the reader's paired `Subscribe { from: next }` — but `asb last`
/// makes no paired read. It prints rows and a MARK and exits, `resume` comes back
/// empty (the range genuinely ran out), and the page is simply one row shorter with
/// nothing on stdout to say so. A caller that reads a short page as "this is the whole
/// answer" — a fleet roster, say — can therefore be one live subject short. THE
/// COMPLETENESS CONTRACT IS `--max` PLUS A `sub --from <next>`, not `--max` alone.
///
/// HONEST BOUNDARY: this walks the index at the broker's scan bound per round trip,
