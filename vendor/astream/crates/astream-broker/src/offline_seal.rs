//! THE OFFLINE SEAL of a plaintext log ([`BrokerLog::seal_plaintext`], feature `at-rest`,
//! unix), and THE SWITCH it ends with, which every open of a real log finishes or undoes
//! (every build).
//!
//! # What the seal does
//!
//! A log written without an at-rest key holds every record in the clear, and an open with a
//! key reads such a log as a legacy v1 sealed one and refuses it (its first record does not
//! authenticate). The seal turns it into a v2 sealed log, offline: no broker may serve it
//! while it runs, and none can, because it holds the log's lock throughout.
//!
//! 1. The plaintext log is opened (its recovery, its identity, its lock) and closed cleanly
//!    at once, so a seal that fails after its open leaves it as a clean stop, readable as
//!    before.
//! 2. A sealed copy is staged beside it under `<log>.sealing`: every retained frame's payload
//!    sealed under the key, bound to a fresh `<log>.seal` binding and to its own offset (the
//!    frames keep their offsets, the base and the batch marks byte for byte); the `.state`
//!    and `.held` sidecars sealed frame for frame the same way; `.base` as it is; the
//!    identity sidecar `.id` the plaintext log's own, closed at the same base and head
//!    (fingerprinting the sealed newest frame, so the next open finds the record it saw
//!    there and moves nothing); and the binding `.seal`. Every file is flushed, then the
//!    directory.
//! 3. The copy is READ BACK before anything of the plaintext log is touched: opened with
//!    the key, bound (`require_bound_at_rest`), its records, broker times, base, head,
//!    identity, lineage, carried state and held store compared with the plaintext log's,
//!    and every frame of the copy, its `.state` and its `.held` opened under the key and
//!    compared byte for byte with the plaintext payload it was sealed from. Any difference
//!    refuses the seal, the plaintext log untouched. The copy is closed cleanly.
//! 4. The switch's MARKER, `<log>.sealmove`, is made durable (tmp, flush, rename, directory
//!    flush): from here on the switch goes forward, over the plaintext log the marker pins
//!    (its length, its newest frame's fingerprint, and a fingerprint of each of its `.base`,
//!    `.state` and `.held`, or that it has none).
//! 5. THE SWITCH: each staged sidecar is renamed over the log's own (`.seal`, `.base`,
//!    `.state`, `.held`, `.id`, in that order), then the staged log over the log, the
//!    directory flushed, and the marker removed (and the directory flushed again).
//!
//! # Wholly plaintext or wholly sealed, after any crash
//!
//! Every open of a real log runs [`settle`] under the log's lock, after the embedder's
//! prepare and before it reads a byte (`BrokerLog::open_core`), so no reader ever meets the
//! switch half done:
//!
//! - the marker is durable: the switch is FINISHED, whatever part of it ran (each rename is
//!   taken only if its staged file is still there, so finishing it twice is finishing it
//!   once). The log is wholly sealed, under the identity it had.
//! - the marker is durable, but the staged log has not taken the name yet and the log there
//!   is no longer the one the marker pins: its length or its newest frame differs, a sidecar
//!   not yet replaced differs, or one it had none of has appeared. A build that does not
//!   settle (an older astream) opened it in the middle of the switch and wrote to it.
//!   Finishing the switch would drop what that build wrote (a record it acked, whose offset
//!   the sealed log would then hand out again under the same identity), and the sidecars
//!   already replaced cannot be put back with certainty, so the open REFUSES
//!   (`InvalidData`, naming the marker) and moves nothing.
//! - there is no marker: the staging is UNDONE (its sidecars removed, then the staged log),
//!   and the log is wholly plaintext, exactly as step 1 left it.
//!
//! Every build runs it, a keyless one too: a build without `at-rest` that met a switch half
//! done would read a sealed log under a plaintext `.id`, or the reverse. A keyless open that
//! finishes a switch then refuses the sealed log it finished, as it refuses every log a
//! `.seal` binding sits beside, before it reads `.state` or `.held`
//! (`refuse_keyless_sealed`, in `store.rs`). The bytes stay as they are.
//!
//! The lock makes the settle safe to run: the seal holds the plaintext log's lock from its
//! first step to its last, and the staged log's from the read-back on, and the staged log is
//! the log once it is renamed over it. So an open that takes the log's lock knows no seal of
//! it is running, and one that cannot is refused (`AlreadyExists`) before it looks. An open
//! that finishes a switch opens and locks the staged log BEFORE renaming it over the name,
//! and keeps that file as the log: the name is never unlocked between the open's lock on the
//! plaintext file and its hold on the sealed one, so no other open meets the switch's last
//! steps or runs its prepare in between.
//!
//! # Honest boundary
//!
//! - The plaintext bytes the switch replaces are UNLINKED, not erased. A filesystem
//!   snapshot, a backup, a copy, or the device's freed blocks can still hold them. The seal
//!   protects the file as it is named and everything written after it; it does not reach
//!   back into what the volume kept.
//! - The `<log>.health` snapshot stays as the last broker wrote it: it holds counts and an
//!   identity, never a record.
//! - It seals what the log retains. Retention's own work is not touched: the `.state` and
//!   `.held` sidecars are sealed frame for frame as they stand, never re-planned.
//! - A replica (`<log>.replica`) is refused: its log is its leader's spine. So is a log
//!   beside an anti-rollback watermark (`<log>.hw`), which a plaintext log never keeps.
//! - Unix only: the switch renames over the files the seal still holds open and locked.
