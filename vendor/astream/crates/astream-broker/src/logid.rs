//! A log's IDENTITY: WHICH log a broker serves, and WHICH incarnation of that log's
//! offsets — what a client that keeps an offset OUTSIDE the log has to check before it
//! trusts that offset again.
//!
//! An offset names a record in ONE log. A consumer that persists one — a
//! delivered-up-to watermark, a topic cursor, "I already acked offset N" — and later
//! reads a DIFFERENT log at the same address applies it to records it never saw: it
//! skips mail below a stale watermark, replays a foreign log's history as new, or
//! answers for the wrong record. The address stays the same when the log file is
//! deleted and recreated, when a repair truncates it and later appends reuse the cut
//! offsets, when an older copy is restored over it, or when the client is pointed at
//! another host's broker. [`LogIdentity`] is how the consumer tells.
//!
//! # What a consumer does when the identity changes
//!
//! Compare the identity a connection reports — `Client::log_identity`, or
//! `Client::seen_log_identity` after an attach, which already sent the `Hello` that
//! carries it — with the identity its persisted offsets were read under. ANY
//! difference, in [`id`](LogIdentity::id) or in
//! [`generation`](LogIdentity::generation), means EVERY offset persisted under the old
//! identity is meaningless against this log: not too high or too low, meaningless.
//! Drop them (or keep them filed under the OLD identity, to resume only if exactly that
//! identity comes back — the same log after an off/on), and start the way a first run
//! does, from a cursor resolved against THIS log: its head, a `Last` snapshot, or a
//! consumer group (group cursors live inside the log and move with it). `None` — a
//! broker that predates log identity — says nothing either way: the client is exactly
//! where it was before this type existed.
//!
//! # Where it lives, and when it changes
//!
//! In a sidecar beside the log, `<log>.id`: a CRC frame holding the identity and what
//! the open that wrote it saw (the retention base, the head, and a fingerprint of the
//! newest record's stored frame) — and, since FORMAT 2, how the run that wrote it stood
//! with the log (serving, stopped cleanly, a flush failed, or cutting), the tier it
//! served, its boot, whether the log was on the boot volume, the DURABLE FLOOR (a head
//! the log is flushed in full through) and the lineage. It is written atomically (tmp
//! file, fsync, rename, directory fsync) during [`BrokerLog`](crate::BrokerLog)'s open,
//! BEFORE the open returns, so no client can be told an identity that a crash then
//! loses — in two phases: before a cut that removes written bytes (the moved identity,
//! so the cut cannot outlive its announcement) and after the open's own fsync (the run
//! serving, the floor at the head: only then is the head durable). A clean close
//! rewrites it once more (`Closed`, the floor raised to the head). An open that cannot
//! write it FAILS, naming it. It is not IN the log because a record there
//! would take an offset (every new log's first publish would move off offset 0) and
//! would be one more hidden record retention must carry; a replica's log is the
//! leader's spine and may not hold a record of its own either.
//!
//! - A log that has never held a record — every log an open creates — gets a fresh
//!   random `id`, generation 0, at each open: nobody can hold an offset into it, and
//!   a sidecar beside it can only be a deleted predecessor's (or its own, from before
//!   it held anything).
//! - A log that holds records and has NO sidecar — one written before log identity
//!   existed — gets a DERIVED `id`, deterministic in its stored bytes (base, head,
//!   first and newest frame), generation 0. A leader and a follower holding the same
//!   records derive the same one. (One whose every record retention pruned stores no
//!   frame to derive from, and is minted a fresh `id` instead.)
//! - A log that holds records beside a sidecar this build cannot read (damaged, or
//!   another sidecar format) gets a fresh random `id`, generation 0 — never a derived
//!   one, which could be an identity the log already had: the sidecar existed, so the
//!   log has had an identity, and only a new one is certainly not it.
//! - Otherwise the sidecar's `id` stands, and the `generation` goes up by one — by
//!   one, whatever the number of causes — when this log's offsets may now name
//!   different records than a client was told:
//!   - [`open_repair`](crate::BrokerLog::open_repair) truncated records, or this
//!     open's recovery cut a torn batch that held written bytes (a record of it, or a
//!     whole-sized frame of it: the recovery cannot tell a torn write from rot in the
//!     newest batch, so a cut that may have removed an acked record is announced);
//!   - the last run SERVED a weak tier ([`Durability::Ordered`](crate::Durability) or
//!     [`Durability::Relaxed`](crate::Durability); an Ordered request served Strict is
//!     recorded as Strict) and did not stop cleanly in THIS boot: its sidecar still
//!     says `Open` and names another boot, a boot it could not read, or a log off the
//!     boot volume — or it says `Lossy` (a durability flush failed), or the embedder's
//!     own prepare said so ([`Prepared::Unclean`](crate::Prepared)). A power loss may
//!     have taken acked records the page cache held (Relaxed), or the newest batches an
//!     ordering barrier had issued but not yet made durable (Ordered), and only a reboot
//!     can have done that: a process crash (`kill -9`) in the same boot loses nothing
//!     (the kernel still holds every byte, and the open's flush makes it durable) and
//!     moves nothing — a batch it left half-written included, which the open cuts as a
//!     write that never finished (see the recovery's same-boot rule). A Strict run never
//!     moves the generation for stopping uncleanly: its acks were on stable media;
//!   - the log is SHORTER than the last open saw, its retention base went backwards,
//!     or the record at the newest offset the last open saw is not the record it saw
//!     there (another log was put under this name).
//!
//!   A move caused by a cut is written to the sidecar BEFORE the cut (phase 1), so a
//!   crash right after a truncation cannot lose it; an open that dies there and is
//!   run again finds the cut already announced and moves nothing more for it.
//! - LINEAGE says where two generations still agree. When the generation moves because
//!   of an unclean stop, this open's own cut or a repair's — and the log before the cut
//!   is neither shorter than the last open saw, nor re-based, nor missing the record it
//!   saw last — the sidecar records `(new generation, common)`, `common` being the
//!   recovered head: offsets below it name the same records under both generations.
//!   [`LogIdentity::continues`] reads the chain (the newest [`Lineage::MAX`] steps), so
//!   a reader holding offsets under an earlier generation resumes at the lower of its
//!   cursor and every `common` since, instead of forgetting: it skips nothing and
//!   re-reads nothing below the fork. A log found shorter, re-based or foreign may be a
//!   restored copy or another file entirely, so it gets NO lineage, and readers forget
//!   as before.
//! - A REPLICA reports its leader's identity: the leader sends it with every
//!   replicated record, and a log that is a replication target adopts it (rewriting
//!   its sidecar) once a batch carrying it commits AND reaches the replica's newest
//!   record. The leader ships in order from what the replica confirmed, so by then
//!   every record the replica holds was appended or compared byte for byte; an echo
//!   of a shared PREFIX vouches for nothing above it (a replica that kept records its
//!   leader has since cut matches below the cut only), and an open that refused a
//!   replicated record for holding a different one adopts nothing more. A leader that
//!   predates log identity sends none, and its followers report their own. A replica never
//!   advances its leader's generation itself — only the leader numbers its own
//!   rewrites, and a follower's `(id, generation + 1)` could be the very name the
//!   leader later gives a rewrite of its own. A replica found rewritten (any of the
//!   cases above) takes a fresh random `id` instead, until its next replicated batch
//!   hands it the leader's again.
//!
//! # Honest boundary
//!
//! - An identity names a LINEAGE of bytes, not a file. A log COPIED elsewhere, with or
//!   without its sidecar, is two logs under one identity as soon as both take writes;
//!   nothing here can tell those copies apart.
//! - A power loss under a weak tier is announced, not prevented: the next open after
//!   the reboot moves the generation (with lineage), so no offset a client kept from
//!   the lost records is trusted against the records that reuse it. Under Ordered the
//!   loss is at most the batches acked since the last full flush (the horizon's, an
//!   escalation's, a clean close's), never an escalated record; under Relaxed, any batch
//!   no full flush covered (the open's, a clean close's, an escalated record's). The
//!   rule rests on the boot id (`astream-sys`): on a host that names none, or a log off
//!   the boot volume, every unclean weak open moves the generation, `kill -9` included
//!   — the price of not knowing. Hibernation keeps the boot and the page cache, and
//!   rightly moves nothing. A Strict-tier log loses no acked record to a power loss:
//!   the torn batch it cuts was never acknowledged.
//! - Rewriting by anything else is detected only against what the LAST OPEN (or clean
//!   close) saw: a rollback that ends at or above that head and keeps the record it saw
//!   last reuses the rolled-back offsets under an unchanged identity.
//! - A log restored from a backup TOGETHER WITH its sidecar carries the backup's
//!   identity, which is also the identity it carried while it grew past the backup:
//!   offsets a client kept from that growth are trusted against the records that will
//!   reuse them. Restore the log file alone — the sidecar already beside it then finds
//!   it shorter, or different, and moves the generation. (A copy taken while the log
//!   was written ends inside a frame; restored alone it is cut to its last whole record,
//!   as a shorter log, never refused as damage below the floor. A copy holding records
//!   past the sidecar's head is read whole, whichever build wrote them — but nothing
//!   here can see that those records are not the ones clients were told about at those
//!   offsets: the rollback residual above.)
//! - A revert to a build that predates log identity never reads or writes `<log>.id`:
//!   the records it appends carry no batch mark, and the next open of a sealing build
//!   reads each as a unit of its own, so none is cut. Its runs record nothing either —
//!   a Relaxed run of such a build that loses power is the one loss no build can
//!   announce.
//! - Deleting `<log>.id` makes the log read as one that predates identity: it
//!   re-derives its id from its bytes at generation 0. That is a new identity unless
//!   the bytes are exactly those of an EARLIER derivation — a pre-identity log that
//!   grew and was then restored to the copy it was derived from derives the identity
//!   it had before the growth, and offsets kept under it past those bytes are
//!   trusted. To give a log a new identity by hand, make its sidecar unreadable
//!   (overwrite it) rather than delete it: an unreadable sidecar always yields a
//!   fresh one.
//! - The `id` is minted from std's per-thread OS-seeded `RandomState` (the same source
//!   as the broker's handshake nonce), and derived with FNV-1a-128: distinct and
//!   collision-resistant against accident, not claimed cryptographic. Anyone who can
//!   write the log's directory can write any identity there.
//! - The identity is told to every peer that sends `Hello`, before it authenticates:
//!   it is a random name for the log, not a secret.
