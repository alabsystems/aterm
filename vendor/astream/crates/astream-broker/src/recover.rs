//! RECOVERY's classifier: what the open does with the bytes after the log's intact
//! prefix — keep them, cut them, or refuse the log — once the recovery scan
//! ([`scan_from`](crate::store::scan_from)) has found where that prefix ends.
//!
//! # Two sets of rules, chosen by what the log's sidecar knows
//!
//! **The durable floor unknown** (no sidecar, a FORMAT 1 sidecar, the open right after
//! a revert): the rules that predate the floor, verbatim. A torn tail — an incomplete
//! last frame, or nothing but zeros — is cut; anything else after the prefix is
//! refused until an operator repairs the log. Every log a sealing build has not yet
//! opened classifies exactly as it did before, marked records being ordinary records.
//!
//! **The durable floor known** (a FORMAT 2 sidecar: everything below the floor was
//! flushed in full by an open or a clean close). Above the floor the log is a run of
//! UNITS: a batch a sealing build wrote, whose records say "the batch continues" until
//! its last carries the seal with its count, or a single record with no mark at all,
//! which a build that predates the marks wrote whole, on its own — a revert to such a
//! build appends those above the floor and never rewrites the sidecar (see
//! [`BREC_VERSION`](crate::BREC_VERSION)). Let `p` be the first byte that is not an
//! intact, in-order record, `e` the offset expected there, and `b0` the start of the
//! unit `p` falls in: the later of the end of the last record that ends a unit before
//! `p` and the floor.
//!
//! - A shape only a writer makes at `p` — a CRC-valid frame that is not the next
//!   record, does not parse, or fails to authenticate, or a record in a newer format —
//!   is refused, as before: no torn write leaves one.
//! - Damage below the floor (`e < floor`) is refused: those bytes were durable when the
//!   floor was recorded, so whatever happened to them is not a torn write. The one
//!   exception is a file that simply ENDS below its floor, inside a frame (a copy taken
//!   while the log was written, restored alone): that is a shorter log, not damage, and
//!   is cut to its last whole record exactly as one that ends on a record boundary is
//!   kept — the identity rules move the generation, with no lineage, for the
//!   shortening.
//! - After an UNCLEAN stop of a Relaxed run (its sidecar names another boot, or none —
//!   [`Prior::unclean`](crate::logid::Prior::unclean)), the log is cut at `p`, keeping the
//!   longest intact prefix: Relaxed issues no flush between opens, so a power loss
//!   leaves holes anywhere above the floor and a complete batch behind one is expected.
//!   The identity's generation moves for the unclean stop itself.
//! - Otherwise (a Strict run, or a Relaxed run reopened in the boot it served in) the
//!   bytes after `p` are RESYNCED: every intact record frame found AT A RECORD'S PLACE
//!   there (below) must belong to the torn batch — at or after `e`, marked as a batch's,
//!   and at or before that batch's own seal, found at most once. Anything else — an
//!   unmarked record (a unit of its own, written whole), one past the batch's seal, a
//!   sealed batch that starts after `b0` (a LATER batch that completed behind the
//!   damage, which the order of writes forbids), a newer-format record — is refused:
//!   the damage is not a torn write. When everything after `p` is allowed, the batch is
//!   torn and the log is cut at `b0`, so it is always a prefix of WHOLE units. A file
//!   that ends inside a sealing build's batch above the floor (records that say the
//!   batch continues, then nothing) is cut at `b0` the same way.
//!
//! Why `b0` and not `p`: rot in the newest batch above the floor cannot be told from a
//! tear by its bytes, so the cut takes the batch's intact records too and the open
//! moves the generation for it (with lineage: nothing below `b0` changed), instead of
//! silently keeping a partial batch whose missing record may have been acked. Cutting
//! at unit boundaries also means a later crash never meets a half-kept batch.
//!
//! # A record's place, and the frames inside record bodies
//!
//! A record's BODY is opaque bytes, and may hold a whole, CRC-valid record frame (a
//! forwarded frame, a bridged one, or one a hostile publisher planted). The resync
//! reads the bytes after `p` with a magic scan, so it meets such a frame when a torn
//! write took the header of the record carrying it. Records from `e` on are dense, so a
//! record with offset `s` can only start a span the `s - e` records before it can fill
//! — at least a minimal frame each, at most a maximal one — and record `e` itself only
//! at `p`. A frame anywhere else is not a record of this log at its place: it is
//! ignored, never refused for. The residual: a planted frame whose offset is exactly
//! one a record of the torn batch could hold at that byte, marked as a different unit,
//! still refuses the torn write it sits in (never a silent cut: the log stays as it is
//! until a repair). A log sealed at rest has no such frames: its bodies are ciphertext.
//!
//! # What "written" means for a cut
//!
//! A cut moves the generation when it may remove a record a client was told about: when
//! it discards an intact record (the torn batch's own, before or after `p`), or when the
//! damaged frame at `p` is the shape a WRITTEN record leaves damaged — WHOLE-SIZED WITH
//! DATA (its header claims a length the file holds and what it claims is not all zeros:
//! the shape rot leaves, since a record's payload always holds its nonzero version byte),
//! or WHOLE TO THE END OF THE FILE under a length field that says otherwise (its CRC
//! holds over exactly the bytes to the end: a whole last record whose length rotted). A
//! header cut short, a length running past the end over bytes that are not the frame
//! its CRC names, a payload that never landed (zeros behind a header), or a header torn
//! after its first four bytes with nothing behind it is a write that never finished, and
//! cutting it moves nothing. Under Strict, the batch a power loss tears was never acked,
//! so a move for it is precaution; it buys an announced loss for rot in an ACKED newest
//! batch.
//!
//! One exception keeps a process crash free: in the SAME BOOT as the run that wrote the
//! log, with the log on the boot volume, the page cache held every byte the dead process
//! wrote, so a file that ends inside the newest batch — its last records cut short, or
//! missing — is a write that process never finished (a `kill -9` stops a write between
//! pages), never acked, and cutting its intact records moves nothing.
