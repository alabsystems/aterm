//! what an open does with files no intent names.
//!
//! Every crash is the seam's ([`Seam::crash_after`]): the compaction stops dead after
//! that durable step, cleaning nothing up. The next open is then tried on each directory
//! the crash can leave: the files as they stand (a process that stopped dead: what the
//! kernel holds survives), and, on unix, every directory a POWER LOSS there can leave
//! (`power_loss.rs`: only what was flushed survives, and of the name changes since the
//! last directory flush only a prefix). No clock is read, nothing sleeps.
//!
//! NEGATIVE CONTROLS (each a planted break, scratch-reverted, that fails the test named):
//! no intent written, the protocol before this one (`a_crash_after_any_durable_step_*`:
//! the reopen after the rename refuses); the intent, the copy and the directory never
//! flushed (the same tests: a power loss after the rename leaves a log its base disowns,
//! or an empty one); no watermark re-identification at the open
//! (`..._under_anti_rollback`: the verified reopen refuses); a re-identification only
//! under a verified open, or none by a keyed compaction that does not verify
//! (`a_keyed_open_that_does_not_verify_leaves_a_watermark_a_verified_open_accepts`); the
//! copy reading its whole range in one read (`the_copy_holds_one_chunk_and_one_frame`);
//! no delta copied at the finish, or the bulk flushed there instead of by the unlocked

//! (`an_open_clears_a_copy_no_intent_names`); a created log that keeps a deleted one's
