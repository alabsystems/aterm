//! A broker connection over a byte stream someone else already authenticated.
//!
//! The broker listens and dials only over the transports it names itself (Unix, TCP, sealed,
//! handshake, identity). An embedder whose machines already hold one authenticated connection
//! (aterm's fleet TLS link, whose peer key is proved against its membership log) hands a stream
//! of that connection to [`Broker::serve_stream`](crate::Broker::serve_stream), and to a bridge
//! as [`FederationWire::Stream`](crate::FederationWire::Stream), rather than open a second
//! listener with a second identity.
//!
//! The broker needs more of a connection than `Read + Write`: its request loop and its
//! ack-writer run at once on one connection, a tail probes its peer under a read timeout, and
//! shutdown or a revocation must end a thread parked in a read from another thread. So a
//! [`StreamLink`] takes `&self`, and is shared. How one direction reads while the other writes
//! is the implementor's to arrange; a socket gets it from the kernel (the implementations here),
//! and a TLS session from a lock its read does not hold while it waits for bytes.
