//! an open that restamps the retained suffix
//! (`an_age_rule_cuts_by_when_a_record_was_first_seen_across_restarts`); stamps read back
//! that are not cut to the head recovered, or cut in memory only
//! (`a_crash_that_loses_stamped_records_never_ages_the_ones_after_it`); a rewrite's

//! (`a_carried_cut_after_a_cut_to_the_head_ages_nothing_at_once`); and, for the
