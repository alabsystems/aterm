//! THE HELD STORE, `<log>.held`: the records below the log's base that a hold rule still
//! wants, each at its ABSOLUTE offset, the floors the records given up raise, and the rules
//! they are held by (`retention.rs`; `REQUIREMENTS-fabric-operations` R4, "Design
//! (2026-10-19)").
//!
//! # The file
//!
//! A sequence of `astream_wire` frames, each payload sealed under the log's at-rest key when
//! it has one, with the AAD [`HELD_AAD`] and the frame's index in the file, so no frame can
//! be moved within the file. That is all the seal binds: a frame from another held store
//! sealed under the same key, or from this one before a rewrite, authenticates at the same
//! index, and a store cut back at a frame boundary reads as one with fewer frames (the
//! log's anti-rollback watermark does not cover the held store, which keeps none of its
//! own; the log's identity is no anchor either, since it is read from the log's first
//! frame, which every compaction changes). Four kinds of frame, each naming the CUT it was
//! written for (the base its compaction takes; the base at the job's begin for `S`):
//!
//! | kind | body |
//! |---|---|
//! | `R` | `cut, k u32, k × since u64, rules`: the rules the store holds by, and from where each of their `k` classes is whole |
//! | `S` | `cut, from u64, n u32, n × (head u64, ms u64)`: the retention tick's stamps (`retention::stamp`) from `from` on: the stamps read so far are cut back to `from` (`retention::clamp_stamps`), then these follow |
//! | `T` | `cut, n u32, n × at_ms u64`, then `n` frames, each a carried record's payload |
//! | `D` | `cut, n u32, n × offset u64, m u32, m × (len u32, subject, floor u64)`: held records given up, and the floors they raise |
//!
//! It starts with an `R` frame; a rules change appends another. Between compactions it is
//! only appended to: a compaction writes what it newly carries and what it gives up, never
//! what the store already holds, and every job first the stamps its tick took since the
//! last it wrote, so a record's age survives a restart (an `S` frame names the base the job
//! began at: a stamp is true whether or not the job's compaction lands). An open whose log
//! ends below the stamps read back (a crash lost records a tick had stamped, and their
//! offsets are taken again by records no tick saw yet) cuts them back to the log's head and
//! appends that cut as an `S` frame of no stamps before the log takes a record.
//!
//! # Crash safety
//!
//! A compaction appends its frames, and flushes them, before it copies the log and writes
//! its intent ([`Step::Held`](crate::compact::Step::Held)), so a compaction that lands
//! always finds its held records beside it. An open that reads a frame naming a cut ABOVE
//! the log's base knows that compaction never landed, and cuts the file there: every frame
//! after it is that compaction's own (compactions run one at a time, and one that fails in
//! process truncates its frames away before the next begins), and the records it carried
//! are still in the log. A file that ends inside a frame (a torn append), or in zeros, is
//! cut at that frame. Anything else that does not read refuses the open, naming the file.
//!
//! # Bounded
//!
//! The held records are bounded by their classes' `max_bytes` (`retention.rs`). The file is
//! REWRITTEN whole (tmp, flush, rename, directory flush) once it is more than twice what it
//! carries, so it stays within a small multiple of the rules' bytes. The per-subject floors
//! are at most [`FLOORS_MAX`] subjects and [`FLOOR_BYTES_MAX`] bytes of names: past either,
//! the lowest floors fold into one SPILL floor that every hold class's reads answer at least
//! (it tells more than it must, never less).
