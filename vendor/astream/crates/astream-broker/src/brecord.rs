//! The broker's durable record skin: a versioned, CRC-framed message carrying its
//! subject and the producer idempotency key. Disjoint from the engine
//! `ENV_VERSION`, the cognition `COG_VERSION`, and the durable-exec `STEP_VERSION`
//! — the broker reuses the `astream_wire::Frame` codec (CRC + 16 MiB cap), not the
//! engine `Envelope` (which carries no `Subject` and no publish key).
//!
//! ONE `encode`/`from_payload` pair is used by BOTH append and recover, so a
//! restart reconstructs records and the dedup map byte-for-byte (round-trip test).

/// Broker record format version (2 adds the optional atomic `commit` annotation).

/// Every stored record's payload starts with this byte, and a log is read record by
/// record, so a log holds whatever versions wrote it. EVERY version keeps the same
/// first nine bytes — this byte, then the record's own offset as a little-endian
/// `u64` — because that prefix is how an older build tells a newer record from
/// damage.
///
/// A FORMAT CHANGE — bumping this, or changing what an existing version's stored
/// bytes mean (a hidden record's body, a durable key's derivation, a sidecar beside
/// the log) — ships, in the same change:
///
/// - a READ-THROUGH: [`BrokerRecord::from_payload`] decodes every version an astream
///   release has written up to the new one (fields the old one lacks take their
///   defaults), so every existing log still opens, while appends write the newest;
/// - a FIXTURE of the previous format: a small log written by the last release,
///   committed as bytes and never regenerated, and a test that this build opens it
///   and reads its records back as that release wrote them.
///
/// The other direction is already handled and needs nothing new: a build that meets
/// a record above its own version refuses the log by name — written by a newer
/// astream, `ErrorKind::Unsupported` — on `open` and `open_repair` alike, never as
/// corruption and never truncated. (v1 is not read: 2b84f85 dropped it with no
/// read-through, before this rule was written down.)
///
/// # The batch marks, in every version from 2 on
///
/// Every record the log writes carries a MARK after its last field. The LAST record of
/// a batch carries a 5-byte SEAL: [`SEAL_TAG`] (`0xB5`), then the batch's record count
/// as a little-endian `u32` (at least 1); the batch is the records
/// `seq - count + 1 ..= seq`. Every OTHER record of the batch carries the one byte
/// [`CONTINUES_TAG`] (`0xB4`): the batch goes on past it. A record with NOTHING after
/// its last field was written by a build that predates the marks. A stored record's
/// payload therefore ends in exactly one of three ways — at its last field, or there
/// plus one well-formed mark — and anything else after the last field is not a record
/// this build reads ([`from_payload`](BrokerRecord::from_payload) answers `None`).
///
/// The seal is how recovery finds a batch's start after a power loss: a torn batch is
/// cut at its start, so the log is always a prefix of whole batches, and a sealed batch
/// found intact BEHIND damage proves the damage is not a torn write (see the store's
/// recovery). The continues mark is how recovery tells a torn batch of a sealing build
/// from records an OLDER build appended: a revert to a build that predates the marks
/// (one that predates log identity, too, never rewrites `<log>.id`, so the durable floor
/// a sealing build recorded there still stands), or a copy such a build wrote restored
/// alone, leaves unmarked records above that floor — each written and acked whole, on
/// its own, as a unit no later seal closes. Without the mark the two are the same
/// bytes: records a batch's lost seal never closed, which recovery cuts. With it, an
/// unmarked record ends a unit exactly as a seal does, and only records that SAY their
/// batch goes on can be a torn batch's.
///
/// The marks claim NO version: they are defined as "the bytes after the record's last
/// field, in every record version from 2 on", so a future version (a writer-staged
/// retire's marker, say) keeps them after its own last field. A different suffix is a
/// version bump under the rule above. They cost one byte per record that is not a
/// batch's last, and five per batch.
///
/// Why inside the record and not a frame of its own: every v2 parser since `2b84f85`
/// returns at the commit field without looking at what follows, so an OLDER build
/// decodes a sealed record as the same record and reads a sealed log unchanged — a
/// revert costs no outage and tempts no repair — and every stored frame is still
/// exactly one record, so no walker of stored frames (the identity fingerprint, the
/// retention cut, the torn-tail probe) changes. The fixtures under
