//! The durable log's STORAGE SEAM: every byte [`BrokerLog`](crate::BrokerLog) reads or
//! writes on its own file, and every read and atomic replacement of its identity
//! sidecar, goes through the two enums here.
//!
//! In a release build each has one variant — `Os`, a real `File` and the log's real
//! path — so every match compiles away to the call it wraps, and a build that gave one
//! another would not compile (the release-build check below, THE RELEASE BUILD HOLDS
//! THE REAL FILE ALONE, and `store.rs`'s on `Storage`). Under
//! `cfg(any(test, debug_assertions))` (aterm's seam rule: a dependent's tests see it
//! with no feature a dev-dependency would flip) each gains a `Sim` variant backed by the
//! simulated device (`sim_device.rs`), which is how the REAL writer (`stage_*` +
//! `commit_batch`) and the REAL open (recovery, the identity rules, both sidecar phases)
//! run unchanged against a device that can lose power after any operation: the crash
//! simulation's (`crash_sim.rs`), and an embedder's through
//! [`SimDevice`](crate::SimDevice). The seam covers the sidecar as well as the log on
//! purpose: a seam over the log alone would make a sidecar written in the wrong order
//! relative to the log's flush invisible, and that order is half of what recovery
//! rests on.
//!
//! Enums, not `dyn` traits: a caller-supplied `dyn` object here would be an open
//! principal for Trust's thread-spawn census (the same reason `Broker`'s `Shared` holds
//! no `dyn Fn`). Retention and anti-rollback stay `Os`-only and refuse `Unsupported` on
//! a simulated log, which the simulation never asks of them.
