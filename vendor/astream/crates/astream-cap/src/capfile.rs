//! The capability FILE: one canonical `<grant> <tag-hex>` line format, and the one
//! reader for it; and the SECRET FILE rule every file of key material is read by.
//!
//! Two rules live here, for one reason: they are the two that every face of astream
//! reads off disk, and both used to be written again by each face that read them.
//! The line format is below. The secret-file rule ([`check_private`],
//! [`read_private_file`], [`read_secret_file`], [`read_secret_in`], [`read_secret_at`],
//! [`read_secret_at_narrowed`], [`SECRET_MIN`]), judged through astream-sys's owner-only rule, is at the end of this doc.
//!
//! A cap file holds a node's whole ring, one minted capability per line, in exactly
//! the shape `asb mint` prints — so the file a mint wrote is the file every face
//! reads, and a ring one face accepts is never refused by another:
//!
//! ```text
//! # this node's ring: the fleet's read half, and its own write lane
//! ro:/f/F/pub/>  <64 hex digits>
//! rw,p=n-a1b2c3d4:/f/F/in/*/*/n-a1b2c3d4/*  <64 hex digits>
//! ```
//!
//! THE RULES, and why each is the one:
//!
//! * A line is trimmed. Empty lines, and lines whose first character is `#`, are
//!   skipped. A grant never begins with `#` (it begins with `/`, `rw` or `ro`),
//!   so a comment can never swallow a capability; a comment is a WHOLE line, and a
//!   `#` after the tag is a malformed tag, never a trailing comment.
//! * The line splits at its LAST ASCII whitespace, never its first, because THE
//!   GRANT MAY CONTAIN A SPACE. `Filter::new` rejects only bytes below 0x20 and
//!   0x7f, and 0x20 is neither, so `ro:/f/F/pub a/>` is a legal grant that a mint
//!   seals and prints. Split at the first whitespace, that line read back as the
//!   grant `ro:/f/F/pub` with the tag `a/>`, and the whole ring was refused. The
//!   last whitespace is exact rather than merely better: the tag is the fixed-width
//!   whitespace-free tail, so even a grant that ENDS in a space round-trips.
//! * The grant half must be non-empty. It is otherwise NOT validated here: it is the
//!   string the tag seals, byte for byte, and whether it is a grant at all is
//!   `Grant::parse`'s question, asked where authority is decided.
//! * The tag half is EXACTLY 64 ASCII hex digits, either case: 32 bytes, one
//!   HMAC-SHA256 output. Strict — no sign, no `0x`, no other length — and decoded by
//!   BYTE, so a multibyte character is simply not hex, never a char-boundary panic.
//!   No error message echoes the tag, because the tag is the secret.
//!
//! [`format_line`] writes a line and [`parse_line`] reads one back; [`parse_text`]
//! and [`read_file`] read a whole ring and name `path:line` for the first line that
//! breaks a rule. A ring is all or nothing: one malformed line refuses the file.
//!
//! SELF-CONTAINED ON PURPOSE: std and astream-sys only, nothing from the rest of
//! this crate. `asb` reads `--cap-file` in its DEFAULT build too — a malformed line
//! is a usage error there as well, and only the attach itself needs the MAC — but a
//! default broker does not depend on `astream-cap` (capabilities are its opt-in
//! `cap` feature), so `asb` compiles THIS FILE into itself by path, and so does
//! `aspump`. Keep it free of `crate::` items and of every dependency but
//! astream-sys (the OS cordon, zero-dependency itself, which astream-broker and
//! astream-pump depend on directly): one source, three builds, and no second reader
//! to drift from the first.
//!
//! THE SECRET FILE. A mint secret (what `Broker::open_guarded` seals and verifies
//! with), a pre-shared transport key and a cap file all hold material that IS
//! authority: whoever reads one can mint, decrypt or attach as its owner. The rule
//! for reading one, and why each clause is the one:
//!
//! * NON-BLOCKING OPEN: the file is opened read-only with `O_NONBLOCK`
//!   ([`astream_sys::open_nonblocking`]), so whatever sits at the path opens at once.
//!   A plain open of a FIFO waits until something opens its other end: a reader
//!   that opened before it judged would hang on one anyone who can write the
//!   directory can make with `mkfifo`. The FIFO is then refused by the next clause.
//! * OWNER-ONLY, judged on the open descriptor by astream-sys's one rule
//!   ([`astream_sys::owner_private`], [`check_private`]), clause by clause: a
//!   REGULAR file (a directory, a FIFO, a socket or a device is `InvalidInput`);
//!   OWNED by this process's effective uid (another user decides who reads it);
//!   `mode & 0o077 == 0`, 0600 or tighter; and on macOS NO ACCESS-LIST ENTRY THAT
//!   ALLOWS anyone anything, because macOS checks an extended ACL before the mode
//!   bits, so a 0600 file with an `everyone allow read` entry (one a parent's
//!   `file_inherit` entry passed on, say) is open to every user. A deny entry takes
//!   nothing away and passes. On Linux a POSIX ACL that grants anyone shows in the
//!   group mode bits, which the mode clause reads. The refusal names the `chmod`
//!   (`chmod 600`, `chmod -N`) rather than fixing the file silently, because a key
//!   that sat readable may already have been read, and the person who owns it
//!   should know that. Off Unix only the kind is checked (there are no mode bits),
//!   and, for a secret, its length.
//! * ONE OPEN: every clause is read off the OPEN file (`fstat` on the descriptor), and a
//!   reader returns the bytes of that same descriptor. A check by path followed by
//!   a read by path resolves the path twice, and whoever can write the directory
//!   can swap a 0600 file for a link to a 0644 one between the two: the check
//!   passes on one file and the key comes from another. So nothing here stats a
//!   path ([`check_private`] opens it too), and a face that READS a secret goes
//!   through [`read_private_file`] or [`read_secret_file`], never a check and then
//!   its own read.
//! * A SECRET IN A DIRECTORY OF ITS OWN ([`read_secret_in`], and [`read_secret_at`]
//!   over one path's directory and name): the directory is opened without following
//!   a link and held to the same owner-only rule as a directory (0700 or tighter,
//!   ours, no ACL allow entry), because whoever can write it can replace the secret
//!   or give it a second name; the name is one path component; the file is opened
//!   without following a link (`O_NOFOLLOW`) and must have ONE link, because a
//!   second name for it may sit in a directory others can reach. The directory's
//!   refusal names the `chmod` that closes it but does not call the secret exposed:
//!   a directory others can open or write lets them replace the secret, not read it,
//!   and the file's own clauses, judged next, say whether others could read it.
//!   [`read_secret_at_narrowed`] is the dry run of a caller that narrows the
//!   directory's mode before it reads. The path readers ([`read_private_file`],
//!   [`read_secret_file`]) still follow a link at the path: an operator who points
//!   `asb --secret-file` at one keeps working.
//! * EXACT BYTES ([`read_private_file`], [`read_secret_file`]): the secret is every
//!   byte the file holds, a trailing newline or space included. A mint secret is
//!   `head -c 32 /dev/urandom`, raw random bytes that begin or end with a whitespace
//!   byte about one time in twenty-five, and the broker that verifies and the verb
//!   that mints must seal with the same key: a reader that trimmed sealed a
//!   different secret from one that did not, silently.
//! * AT LEAST [`SECRET_MIN`] = 32 bytes ([`read_secret_file`]): HMAC takes a key of
//!   any length, so an empty or truncated secret mints capabilities that look
//!   well-formed and seal nothing.
//! * PATH-FIRST REFUSALS, as `io::Error`s whose kind says which clause broke:
//!   `NotFound` (the file is not there, which a caller may answer with a hint),
//!   `PermissionDenied` (another owner, a group/other bit, an ACL allow entry, a
//!   symlink or a second link where [`read_secret_in`] refuses them, or an OS
//!   refusal to open it), `InvalidInput` (not a regular file, a directory that is no
//!   directory, a name of more than one component, or a path that names no file)
//!   and `InvalidData` (too short). Every message starts with the path, once, as its
//!   caller spelled it (a bare name is not `./<name>`): an OS error, which never
//!   names one, is re-wrapped as `<path>: <error>` with its kind kept, so a caller
//!   prefixes only its own flag (`--secret-file {e}`) and never names the path twice.
//!
//! `asb` reads `--secret-file` through [`read_secret_file`], and `serve` reads the
//! `--key-file` it serves under through [`read_private_file`] (the key is hex, so
//! `asb` trims and decodes it, and its own decoder holds it to 32 bytes). aterm's
//! fabric reads its `mint.secret` through [`read_secret_at`] (its
//! `read_mint_secret`, for `aterm link broker --secret-file`, `aterm link mint` and
//! `aterm fabric on`/`mint-for`), so the broker that verifies and the verb that mints
//! read a secret by this one code, and `fabric on --dry-run` through
//! [`read_secret_at_narrowed`] when its root step would narrow the root. [`read_file`] does
//! NOT check a cap file's mode: a face that wants that reads the file with
//! [`read_private_file`] and parses it with [`parse_text`].
