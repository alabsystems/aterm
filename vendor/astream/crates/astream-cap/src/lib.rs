#![deny(dead_code)]
//! `astream-cap` — the unforgeable capability mint: the capability/ACL half of
//! "SSH" for untrusted-network use (the doctrine's "sound, unforgeable capability
//! mint") — WHO may attach where. The confidentiality/authentication half is the
//! sibling crate `astream-aead` (an XChaCha20-Poly1305 sealed wire), deliberately
//! a separate crate so its vetted cipher dependency stays isolated: this crate
//! takes no third-party dependency at all.
//!
//! A **capability is a signed grant**. A grant is an [`astream_wire::Filter`] —
//! the subject subtree its bearer may attach/observe/drive — optionally prefixed
//! with a *mode*, a *principal* and an *expiry*:
//!
//! ```text
//! grant := [ ("rw" | "ro") { "," field } ":" ] <filter>
//! field := "p=" <principal> | "exp=" <unix-ms>     each at most once, either order
//!   /f/F/pub/>            read-write, unbound, never expires (the bare-filter form)
//!   ro:/f/F/fleet/>       read-only: subscribe/fetch, never publish or commit
//!   rw,p=n-a1b2c3d4:/f/F/in/*/*/n-a1b2c3d4/*
//!                         read-write, and only as producer_id_of("n-a1b2c3d4")
//!   rw,exp=1700000000000:/f/lab/>
//!                         read-write until that instant, and nothing from it on
//! ```
//!
//! The prefix is unambiguous *because* [`Filter::new`] rejects any string without
//! a leading `/`: a prefixed grant can never parse as a filter, and a filter can
//! never carry a prefix. The broker holds a secret key, mints a capability by
//! tagging the **whole grant string** with HMAC-SHA256, and verifies a presented
//! capability by recomputing the tag and comparing it with a fold over all 32
//! bytes that has no early exit on the first differing one — so the mode and the
//! principal are exactly as unforgeable as the filter, and a bare filter still
//! mints and verifies over byte-for-byte the same message it always did.
//!
//! The **producer id** is derived by the broker from the principal the grant names
//! ([`producer_id_of`]), never chosen by a bearer. [`grants_publish`] refuses a
//! publish whose `producer_id` a bound grant does not derive, which is what closes
//! dedup-key poisoning: a co-permitted publisher pre-publishing a peer's next
//! `(producer_id, producer_seq)` so the peer's genuine record silently dedups away
//! to the attacker's offset.
//!
//! [`attach_proof`] / [`verify_attach`] are the proof of possession that keeps the
//! tag off the wire: the client answers a broker-chosen per-connection nonce with
//! `HMAC-SHA256(tag, nonce ‖ grant)`, so the tag is never readable out of a stream
//! and a captured attach cannot be replayed onto another connection.
//!
//! [`capfile`] is the one format a capability is STORED in — the `<grant> <tag-hex>`
//! line `asb mint` prints and every `--cap-file` reads — and the one reader for it,
//! so a face that presents a ring reads it by these rules instead of its own.
//!
//! Crypto honesty: the MAC is **HMAC-SHA256 per RFC 2104** — a standard
//! construction, not an invented MAC — and it is not this crate's:
//! `astream-digest` owns the workspace's one HMAC (`hmac_sha256_parts`, the const
//! core this crate wrote and gave it) over its own SHA-256 after FIPS 180-4, each
//! compression round checkable against the standard, pinned to the FIPS vectors, and
//! held byte-for-byte to the `sha2` crate it replaced over every length 0..=1024. The
//! MAC is pinned there to all seven RFC 4231 cases; the tags, attach proof and producer
//! ids this crate answered over `sha2` are pinned here as recorded answers. No cipher is built
//! here: encrypting the wire is
//! `astream-aead`'s job (ring's ChaCha20-Poly1305 under an in-crate HChaCha20
//! subkey: XChaCha20-Poly1305), wired into the broker
//! as `serve_tcp_sealed`; a guarded broker (`open_guarded`) composes the two.

// A contracted fn is written once, through `contract_fn!`: under a Trust compiler
