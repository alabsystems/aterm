//! A log's identity and lineage as the bus carries them: [`LogIdentity`] (WHICH log, and
//! WHICH incarnation of its offsets) with its `<id>.<generation>` text form and its
//! 24-byte wire form, and [`Lineage`] (where two generations of one log still agree) with
//! [`LogIdentity::continues`], the one reading of it.
//!
//! The vocabulary lives here, beside the frame and the subject grammar, so that a reader
//! that keeps offsets OUTSIDE the log — an embedder's bridge, a session endpoint, a cursor
//! file — parses, compares and continues an identity exactly as astream does without
//! linking the broker. What a consumer does when the identity changes, and when a broker
//! moves it (the `<log>.id` sidecar, the unclean-stop rules, a replica adopting its
//! leader's), is `astream-broker`'s `logid` module's to say; a broker re-exports both
//! types from there.
