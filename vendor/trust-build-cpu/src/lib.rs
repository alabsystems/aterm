//! Kernel-held CPU leases for cooperating build schedulers.
//!
//! A lease covers one executing unit, not a whole build. There is no daemon,
//! permanent reservation, or process-name registry. A scheduler acquires a
//! lease before starting a unit and keeps it until the unit and its inherited
//! work end. Dropping the final descriptor releases the kernel lock, including
//! after an abnormal process exit. Local jobserver and memory policy remain
//! the caller's responsibilities.
//!
//! Slot records are diagnostics, not authority. Only the kernel lock makes a
//! slot busy; a stale record in an unlocked file never consumes capacity.
//! An owner read while a lock is held is a reported identity, not independent
//! proof that the process currently holds that descriptor.
